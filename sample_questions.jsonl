I'm pleased to deliver today's opening remarks on behalf of Mr. Chen.\nThe second quarter was another strong quarter of growth for Bilibili. Owing to our increasing diverse content and wider awareness of our brand, we are reaching a much broader audience. For the second quarter, MAUs were 172 million, up 55% and DAUs were up 52% to 51 million, both on a year-over-year basis. Mobile MAUs continued to be our fastest grower, reaching 153 million in the period, up 59% compared to the same period in 2019.\nAlong with the expanded user base, user engagement continues to be strong. In the second quarter, our users spent an average of 79 minutes per day on our Bilibili app, making us one of the most popular platforms among our peers. As we move into our peak summer season, with solid execution of our initiatives, we're looking forward to further building on our user growth momentum.\nWe continue to rollout more premium content and services, strengthen our monetization capabilities, and we are increasingly converting traffic to paid users. Our MPUs were up 105% year-over-year, reaching 12.9 million in the second quarter, and our paying ratio improved to 7.5%, compared to 5.7% from the same period last year. These increases fueled our top line growth and we once again reached record high revenues of RMB2.6 billion, beating the high-end of our guidance.\nOur gross margin expanded to 23% from 16% in the second quarter of last year as we continued to realize more operating leverage.\nWe remain committed to our user growth focused strategy. After 11 years of cultivation, we believe our content pool is deep and diverse enough to accommodate a much larger user base, and our community is friendly and robust enough to retain those newcomers. Hence, we have made more proactive user growth plans. Our primary areas of focus are on creating additional brand awareness and targeted channel acquisition. In the second quarter, we launched a series of campaigns aimed at spreading the Bilibili brand name among a broader audience, in tandem with expanding our content appeal to a mass market. During our 11th anniversary, we introduced a new slogan Bilibili-All the Videos You Like, helping to define our brand proposition and appeal to a wider base. With this vision in mind, we launched a branding campaign series that started with our blockbuster New Year's Eve gala in the first quarter, followed by the Hou Lang, Ru Hai, Xi Xiang Feng trilogy videos, which all have been widely successful, and we are seeing a clear uptick in brand perception and brand awareness across different demographics. This strategy is working well for us and we are determined to carry on as we move into the summer peak season.\nLooking ahead, a number of positive industry trends are working in our favor. The adoption of a faster network and smarter hardware is making content creation easier and more accessible to everyone. Particularly, the video industry is emerging as the biggest beneficiary. Video is rapidly becoming the most interactive and influential method to convey information. Building on a decade of experience and leadership in the video community, we are well positioned to capture the growth opportunity.\nWith that overview, I would like to walk through the latest updates of our content, community, commercialization and strategic growth plans. First, our content. Our PUGV ecosystem remains the cornerstone of our business. For the past decade, we have carefully cultivated our PUGV community, and risen as the clear industry leader. Our effective traffic distribution mechanism and friendly community environment make Bilibili an increasingly attractive platform for content creators. In addition to easy-to-use tools that make the content creation process simpler and more accessible, we launched our new ad platform to bring more commercial opportunities to our content creators. For the second quarter, we had approximately 1.9 million content creators uploading 6 million videos per month, representing increases of 123% and 148%, respectively, both year-over-year.\nFor the second quarter, our most heavily trafficked verticals were lifestyle, game, entertainment, animation and tech and knowledge. With rapid trends in video content, newcomers and key opinion leaders from other platforms are turning to Bilibili. In the first half of 2020, the number of content creators who submitted their first video creation trial grew by 139% year-over-year. These creative minds open Bilibili up to expanded content categories. For instance, we officially launched a knowledge sector to encourage content creators to share their insights, such as business stories, how-to skills and professional experiences. With our effective operational campaigns and welcoming community atmosphere, knowledge has quickly become the fastest growing sector and we have ever seen -- we have seen excellent traction.\nTurning to our OGV. We remain as the dominant leader in the animation field with one of China's largest anime libraries. Since beginning of this year, there were three new Chinese animes joined our 100 million video views club, including White Cat Legend, Da Li Si Rizhi, and our self-produced The Daily Life of the Immortal King, Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo, and Carp Reborn, Yuan Long. Additionally, we plan to rollout more Bilibili-produced Chinese animes, including Ling Cage, Ling Long, A Mortal's Journey, [Foreign Speech] and The Legend of Tang [Foreign Speech]. We believe these new series will attract even more Chinese anime lovers to our platform in this summer.\nAs a supplement to our vast content library, we expanded variety shows and documentaries continued to resonate with fans and provide good advertising avenues to our business partners. In August, we were excited to introduce our very first self-produced music variety show Rap for Youth [Foreign Speech], sponsored by Alibaba's Juhuasuan. We hope this rap-themed talent show will help further expand our content offerings, while inspiring our content creators and young generations alike.\nIn the documentary department, we are pleased to have received wide recognition, not only from our users, but also professional institutions. Two of our Bilibili-produced documentaries were nominated by Bai Yu Lan for the Best Documentary Award, including And Yet the Books [Foreign Speech] and Police Stories [Foreign Speech]. The Hidden Kingdoms of China, a documentary that we co-produced with National Geographic, was nominated as the Best Limited Series-Long Form documentary by Jackson Wild Media Award.\nTurning to our community. Our community size and engagement have been accelerating rapidly. Our platform is more robust than ever, and we are seeing record highs across all of our primary engagement metrics. In the second quarter, our daily video views reached 1.2 billion, up 97% year-over-year. And our users generated nearly 5.2 billion monthly interactions through bullet chats, comments, likes and Bilibili moment posts, nearly three times the amount from the same period in 2019.\nOur official membership program is on a similar growth track. By the end of the second quarter, we had 89 million official members who passed our 100-question exam, up 65% year-over-year. Retention for this group remains well above 80%, demonstrating the loyalty of our users.\nTurning to our commercialization progress, I will first review the status of our game business. Revenues from our mobile games business were up 36% year-over-year to RMB1.2 billion, accounting for 48% of our total revenues. Building on our massive and expanding gamer community, our distribution power in the ACG sector is becoming even stronger. In the second quarter, we were excited to add the new blockbuster title Princess Connect! [Foreign Speech] to our game portfolio. This exclusively licensed Japanese RPG was an instant hit after its release in April, and topped China's iOS download and grossing charts multiple times. Our legacy title Fate Grand Order, or FGO, continues to hold a considerable draw for its stable fan base. At the end of June, we were excited to celebrate Azur Lane's three-year anniversary with a major content update and accompanying offline activities. The long life cycles of these games continues to be a strong testimony to our ability to operate and sustain high quality games.\nLooking at our game pipeline. Currently, we have 11 games that have acquired approvals and are scheduled to be released in the coming months. These include Magia Record, [Foreign Speech], a highly anticipated ACG title adapted by a popular Japanese anime, and Sword Art Online, [Foreign Speech], an exciting MMORPG. Additionally, while strengthening our ACG game operation, we continue to expand offerings in high-quality games. At the end of June -- July, we hosted our first-ever game release event Enter Your Fantasy World, where we introduced 11 exciting titles across different genres. These included simulation game Dark Boom, [Foreign Speech], a self-developed ACG game; [Foreign Speech], a highly anticipated title adapted from our self-owned Chinese anime IP; and, several high-quality ACG titles, [Foreign Speech] and [Foreign Speech]. In August, we are delighted to announce we are going to bring Chinese audiences the mobile version of Fall Guys, [Foreign Speech], an exciting casual Battle Royale game.\nAs we solidify our game-related content offerings and welcome more game lovers to our platform, Bilibili has become the go-to place for joint operating partners. In the second half of the year, we will continue to work with leading game developers to bring our users premium games such as Mihoyo's Genshin Impact and NetEase's Harry Potter.\nTurning to our VAS business. Revenues from VAS increased by 153% year-over-year, reaching RMB825 million in the second quarter. Our growth was mainly driven by increased contribution from premium memberships, live broadcasting and other value-added services. We continued to enrich our live broadcasting content and increase the penetration among our growing traffic. As our platform becomes more influential in China's online entertainment industry, we have seen more hosts and talent agencies turning to Bilibili to grow their fan base and maximize their commercial potential.\nOn the e-sports front, our three-year strategic partnership with Riot Games will significantly enhance our position in this area. We will join forces with Riot Games and the local government to host diversified online and offline activities to promote world-renowned League of Legends World Championship events, while bringing more e-sports lovers to Bilibili.\nOur premium memberships, which offer additional exclusive or advanced content to paid users, continued to flourish in the second quarter. By the end of June, we had 10.5 million premium members, up 100% year-over-year. These members represent the golden cohort of our most loyal users, who are also the most primed for future cross-selling opportunities. Notably, our comic business is also on the rise. Within two years, Bilibili Comic has grown from scratch to top three comic platforms in China, with over 1 million paid subscribers. As a natural extension from our core ACG content offering, we see great synergy between our main app and Bilibili Comic app with significant room to grow.\nAs for our advertising business, our growing user base and increased brand awareness make Bilibili a must go-to platform for advertisers. Despite the tough macro economic environment, we grew our advertising business to RMB349 million, up 108% year-over-year and continued to broaden our customer base. The leading industry verticals in the period were games, e-commerce, 3C products, food and beverage and education.\nIn summary, we had another strong quarter of growth and we are well poised to continue on this trajectory. Building on the positive momentum in the first half of this year, we plan to make additional investments in branding and channels in the coming quarters to further drive user growth and raise brand awareness. We believe these investments will boost our self-fulfilling growth cycle and yield considerable return in the long run. As we reach new heights, our focus will remain on the quality of growth and we will continue to closely monitor the ROI of our marketing expenses. We are confident that our effective strategic initiatives will further fuel our user growth and support our top line expansion as we continue to build value for our Company, investors and growing community of users.\nThis concludes Mr. Chen's remarks. I will now provide a brief overview of our financial results for the second quarter of 2020.\nOur total net revenues increased by 70% year-over-year to RMB2.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance. With our games accounting for just under half of our total revenues, we are pleased to -- with the commercialization progress of our non-game offerings and our ability to convert our online traffic into paying users. The average number of monthly paying users increased by 105% year-over-year, reaching 12.9 million in the second quarter.\nCost of revenues increased by 57% year-over-year to RMB2 billion. Revenue-sharing cost, a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB1 billion, a 79% increase from the same period in 2019.\nGross profit increased by 140% year-over-year to RMB604 million. We are also starting to see operating leverage from our diversified revenue streams. With more revenue contribution from our higher margin business, as well as additional income from paying users, our gross profit margin continued to improve, reaching 23% in the second quarter.\nTotal operating expenses increased to RMB1.2 billion, up 103% from the same period in 2019.\nSelling and marketing expenses were RMB675 million, representing a 181% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili's app and brand, as well as expenses for the Company's mobile games and selling and marketing personnel.\nG&A expenses were RMB208 million, representing a 48% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in G&A personnel and increased share-based compensation expenses.\nR&D expenses were RMB331 million, representing a 53% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel and increased share-based compensation expenses.\nNet loss was RMB571 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared to RMB315 million in the same period of 2019. Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, was RMB476 million, compared to RMB256 million in the same period of 2019.\nBasic and diluted net loss per share were RMB1.63. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB1.35.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, as well as short-term investments of RMB15.6 billion, or $2.2 billion, compared to RMB8.1 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nFor the third quarter of 2020, we are currently projecting net revenues to be between RMB3.05 billion and RMB3.10 billion.\nThank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go ahead.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question in queue comes from the line of Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Alex, please ask your question. Your line is open.\nAlex Poon -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n[Foreign Speech] My first question is regarding the user growth. First half, the user growth is very strong. May I know -- can you share with us the quality and retention and the user profile of the new user growth in first half and about the second half growth and also next year, what is the key focuses of your strategy of user growth? How are you going to balance the user retention and maintain the fast user growth in second half of next year? Thank you very much.\nRui Chen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n[Foreign Speech] I will translate for Mr. Chen. Last year, we have reinforced and reaffirmed user growth will be our key strategic focus and we have been carrying out the strategy efficiently going through the first half of this year, and have made very positive progress.\nAs for the new user profile you asked, there is no significant change of the new user profile, we still see a lot of new young generations that are coming in. The average age of our new user is about 20 years old. However, we would like to emphasize during the user growth process, we're more focused on the quality over quantity, and the quality of our users can be supported by the daily time spend, daily time spend of 79 minutes per day. And our user engagement were up to 5.2 billion on a monthly basis, and our daily video views reached 1.2 billion. So, all of these numbers supported our users are not growing very -- not only growing very fast, their quality are very, very high.\n[Foreign Speech] And notably, we've noticed that the new user who come in during the first half of 2020 and also paid for our services within the same period, the ratio has significantly increased compared to the same period last year. And also the new users who came on our platform during 2017, 2018 and 2019 who also stayed and paid for the next few years, their paying ratio is also increasing. So, once again, the -- this set of numbers is a strong testimony of the quality of our new user growth.\n[Foreign Speech] So here we also wanted to emphasize the methodology of our user growth. The reason why we are very confident in the user growth trajectory is based on the concept that we have been really emphasizing that we use our content to attract user and use our community to retain users. And as you may notice in the first half of this year, we've done some significant progress to allow our content to reach a much broader audiences. And this type of user growth cannot be achieved by purely channel acquisition or user acquisition. If a user comes to our platform simply through the channel acquisition, we cannot retain them if there's no good content. And the key strategy is to allow our content to grow to a much broader category, and this opens up to new -- for us to new demographics.\n[Foreign Speech] And Bilibili is a community with high engagement level and high retention level. Although our users increased significantly, our overall community maintains the same intensity and continues to be very sticky and with high retention rate.\n[Foreign Speech] I'll update you the schedule of our user growth plan. So everybody know during Q1, the pandemic period, people have more time in their hands, so that gives us very good window to invest in user growth. And the second quarter, as people are going back to work and return to school, it came to a more stabilized period that we'll be focusing on raising our retention and converting those users to pay users. And notably, we've also made very good progress to raise our brand awareness in the second quarter and achieve pretty good results. And in the Q3 is traditionally strong peak season for us, so that we plan to make additional investment in both brand, as well as channel acquisition.\n[Foreign Speech] I would also update you with our brand -- branding campaigns. In the second quarter, starting from May, we have made a very successful marketing campaign trilogy profits with Hou Lang, Ru Hai and Xi Xiang Feng, and we believe this series of campaigns as a complete marketing event, which we consider to be the most successful branding campaign among Chinese Internet companies during the second quarter.\n[Foreign Speech] This proves our ability to not only to do amazing events among young generation, but we also have the ability to touch much wider, broader audiences.\n[Foreign Speech] And the reason why we want to emphasize on branding campaign is based on our business model, we use content to attract user and community to retain user. As our content continues to evolve to reach broader audiences, one important step, too, is to allow more people to know that Bilibili have so much content to offer, which are in line with our new brand slogan Bilibili-All the Videos You Like.\n[Foreign Speech] Okay. As far as our Q3 user outlook, we believe we'll reach historical highs during this quarter. And this summer is a little bit special because in July, a majority of the students are still in school, and August is a full month of summer vacation, and September will be the period where students are returning to school. So, in August, we believe we are able to achieve a pretty high MAU target, and on quarterly, monthly average basis we believe we can reach historical high.\n[Foreign Speech] So, on a single month basis, we believe we can achieve over 200 million MAU target during Q3, on a single month basis.\nCarly Lee -- Vice Chairwoman and Chief Operating Officer\n[Foreign Speech] Carly would like to supplement a few points. During our brand upgrade campaign this year, our overall brand exposure has achieved over 5 billion times. And the brand recognition level among -- just among the age brackets in between 17 to 35 has raised to 80% -- I'm sorry, 60%. And in the second half, our main focus will be on to convert people from recognizing Bilibili brand to turning to Bilibili users. And we -- during the second half, the marketing campaign were [Phonetic] surrounded our key activity around the key time slots, such as the summer vacation and returning to school, as well as the League of Legends World Championship and our New Year's Eve Gala and many work-like scenario among young generation and to create new content, new brand campaigns and further drive our user growth.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Lei Zhang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Lei, your line is now open.\nLei Zhang -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n[Foreign Speech] Thanks, management, and congrats on the strong results. My question is actually regarding your game business, which is quite solid in the second quarter. I wonder could you share more color on the performance of Princess Connect!. Specifically, what's your expectation on the longevity for this game?\nAnd secondly, can you give us some update on your game pipeline? Any game launch we can expect, specifically your expectation about the mobile version of Fall Guys? Thank you.\nRui Chen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n[Foreign Speech] Regarding Princess Connect! Re:Dive, it's like we expect this game will be having very long life cycle, and we expect this game to last quite -- to quite a long period. And for this game, our -- in many aspects, it has broke the historical record. In terms of pre-registered number, we have over 6.5 million people pre-registered, and the newly added user for this game also achieved a record high number. And the success of this game proves two one. One is that the ACG game has become the mainstream of young generation preferences over game genres. And second is, over the years, our ability to operate and sustain our ACG titles have improved significantly. And we're quite confident to continue the success.\n[Foreign Speech] And for games like Princess Connect!, with such large user base and within the four-month period of operating history, it has been very smooth in terms of operations and technical operations. So, this once again support our testimony that Bilibili is able to operate this genre's game quite well. As for the long life -- the life cycle of this game, we expect it could be something like FGO and to last couple of years.\n[Foreign Speech] As for our game -- overall game business, currently, we have over 30 games in our pipeline. And those games are not only ACG titles, we have been actively expanding our content offerings across different genres since last year, and we've made a quite good progress on some of the console games, indie games and have received good results.\n[Foreign Speech] The Fall Guys game that you mentioned is another example of our successful attempt in expanding into new genres. And looking ahead, we'll continue to explore the new genres that will fit to our user demographic.\n[Foreign Speech] In terms of revenue contribution, we believe ACG titles still have advantage in this area. And in our pipeline, we believe the Sword Art Online: Integral Factor will be a title that could make decent contribution in the revenue department.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Daniel Chen from J.P. Morgan. Daniel, please ask your question. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Chen -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\n[Foreign Speech] Thanks, management. I have a question on advertising. Our ad revenue growth actually accelerated on a year-over-year basis from -- in the second quarter. Should we expect the ad revenue to sustain such strong momentum in the second half? What are the key drivers behind? Is it brand advertising? Or is it because of performance advertising, including fees? So, what is our expectation for the new ad system we launched in the third quarter for the content providers? Thank you.\nCarly Lee -- Vice Chairwoman and Chief Operating Officer\n[Foreign Speech] Overall 2020 is still full of uncertainties and lots of vitality. However, under this challenging macro environment, we still delivered a pretty good advertising growth rate at 108% year-over-year.\n[Foreign Speech] So Bilibili has a video platform, we are one of the biggest beneficiary in the overall videolization industry trend. And we have observed that the advertisers' budget has shifted from the traditional portal to the video platforms.\n[Foreign Speech] As we mentioned earlier, we have invested significantly in expanding our brand awareness and raised our brand influence in the first half. And we have become the must go-to platform for advertisers, who wanted to reach the younger generation demographic, at the same time we also become the media center to create viral marketing event. And Bilibili's brand upgrade, brand awareness increases has direct relationship with advertisers' perception toward Bilibili's brand proposition.\n[Foreign Speech] So, as our user continue to grow and our PUGV ecosystem continue to thrive, we've seen that we've made decent progress in expanding advert content verticals, such as fashion, lifestyle, technology, fitness, as well as autos. So we are also hoping to reach, expand our advertisers' customers into those industry verticals.\n[Foreign Speech] So during the second quarter, we didn't make any singular marketing campaign toward certain verticals, but rather emphasizing our overall marketing solutions, as well as Bilibili's brand propositions and influence. And it's working well for us. And we aim to continue this strategy going forward.\n[Foreign Speech] The reason that the supporting system behind our Q2 strong growth is on our improvement in terms of our advertising products and our advertisers verticals, as well as our AI-powered algorithms to improve our ad efficiencies. And we're confident to carry on this good trajectory into the third quarter.\n[Foreign Speech] So looking ahead in Q3 and Q4, we are quite confident we can deliver a continued growth rate on our advertisement business and to develop a Bilibili specialty advertisement solution campaign.\n[Foreign Speech] So the area of focus could be on the e-commerce area. Bilibili's vibrant and engaged community has become many e-commerce platforms' ideal platform to promote shopping festivals and shopping events. So in the second half of this year, this could be a rising sector for us.\n[Foreign Speech] So as our content verticals expansion, we are quite confident to also expand our advertisers in those verticals.\n[Foreign Speech] The third point would be on the continuous improvement on our algorithm. We will continue to invest in improving our advertisement efficiency to increase our advertisers' ROI. And the fourth point is on the big events in the second half, there could be new variety shows, as well as new events and gala. And this type of Bilibili specialty event has become the advertisers' favorite advertising avenues to reach young audiences.\n[Foreign Speech] So the Sparkle [Phonetic] platform is a new platform we launched to help our content creators to connect with brand advertisers. And this platform provides our content creators, a pricing system, order management, as well as settlement services. We're hoping this platform will better serve our content creators to increase and expand their commercial potentials and increase their incomes.\n[Foreign Speech] Since its launch in July, we have over 8,000 content creator have already participated and signed up for this platform. For the GMV, we'll disclose when we reach a certain milestone.\n[Foreign Speech] And lastly, we'll continue to focus on ways of improving our data power to provide better decision making assistance, pre-sale or post-sale and to increase our content creators' earning power.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Liu from China Renaissance. Alex, please ask your question. Your line is now open.\nAlex Liu -- China Renaissance Securities Limited -- Analyst\n[Foreign Speech] I'll translate myself very quickly. Just wondering what are the major difference in terms of operating know-how and the roadmap between live streaming business and all the core business. Should we consider live streaming as a business that requires some time of incubations and will reach an inflection point on user adoptions? If that's the case, how far are we standing from that inflection point? Thank you.\nRui Chen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n[Foreign Speech] Live broadcasting business is, as we mentioned earlier, has always been a part of our content ecosystem. This is not a singular commercialization avenue for us, but also an important part of our content. A live broadcasting also provides a very good avenue for our content creators to activate and retain their followers, as well as for them to increase their commercialization potential.\n[Foreign Speech] So, in the past few years, you may have noticed there's such heavy competition among other live broadcasting platform. However, Bilibili has remained within our own self-sustaining ecosystem that continuously helped talented content creators rising above, and they become our live broadcasting host and are providing very good content. This is quite different. Bilibili's business, live broadcasting business is quite different from other singular live broadcasting platform.\n[Foreign Speech] Our content offering on the live broadcasting business is actually mirroring what we have to offer on the video platform. For example, our popular game-related video would also be our popular live broadcasting content. And hence that, on Bilibili's live broadcasting verticals, games and talent shows and lifestyle-related content are the top verticals.\n[Foreign Speech] So you may have seen on our platform, a lot of the popular live broadcasting hosts are also our top popular top content creators. And there are two key factors among the live broadcasting industry. One is the good base of live broadcasting host, and second is a good base of users. And we believe we have these particular audiences for the two factors. We have both the highest quality content creator as, aka, our live broadcasting host, and we also have a very high-quality set of users who love to watch live broadcasting content.\n[Foreign Speech] So compared to other live broadcasting platforms, you're right about the revenue trajectory, we tend to have more stable growth instead of a sharply increased circle because their platform might pursuing [Phonetic] the signing top content host, which will drive the revenue in a short-term. But the merits of our business model is we tend to have a more stable and sustaining life cycle and our content creator, the live broadcasting hosts life cycle will also tend to be longer period.\n[Foreign Speech] We're quite confident to become the best platform for video content creators, given that the video equals live broadcasting content on our platform, we're also quite confident that will become one of the most popular live broadcasting platform in the future.\nOperator\nAnd that concludes the question-and-answer session.

Please see the cautionary statements in today's press release and in our various Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\nFinally, some of today's remarks will adjust for those items that affect comparability between periods. These items are explained in our non-GAAP reconciliations included in our press release. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ron.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, and good afternoon everyone. I hope you and all your families are doing well in these turbulent times. Griffon entered the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic from a position of strength, both operationally and competitively. Building on our already strong results in this fiscal year prior to March, our businesses have benefited from the stay-at-home nature of the pandemic. Both existing and new customers have been investing in home projects such as closet renovations, tending to their lawns and gardens and enhancing their enjoyment of the outdoors, upgrading the exterior of their homes, including their garage doors. We believe these trends will continue to grow in the years ahead.\nOur third quarter results were outstanding. Revenues increased 10%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% and adjusted earnings per share increased 90% compared to the prior year period. These results are a reflection of the strategic actions taken by Griffon starting with the September 2017 announcement regarding the disposition of our Plastics business and the purchase of ClosetMaid, further enhanced by the purchase of CornellCookson in June of 2018, coupled with the home improvement trends that I described. Our pivot out of the capital-intensive, commodity-driven Plastics business into branded domestically manufactured Consumer and Professional Product businesses positioned us for market share gains, as well as revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth.\nFurther underscoring this quarter's results, our 2020 nine-month free cash flow increased $34 million over the comparable 2019 nine-month period and builds on the prior year's full year free cash flow of $69 million. As a result of this performance, our net debt to EBITDA leverage has been reduced by one full turn from the prior year quarter to 4.4 times.\nEnsuring the health and safety of our employees and our customers continues to be our top priority. Since early March, we have proactively implemented health and safety measures across our global workforce as local and national authorities have circulated additional guidelines for employee health and safety. We've incorporated those as well. All of our facilities are operational and continue to maintain additional safety measures to protect our workers, while maintaining operations.\nIn Consumer and Professional Products and Home and Building Products, all of our U.S., Canadian, and Australian facilities were operational throughout the quarter. This includes all AMES, Closetmaid, Clopay and CornellCookson facilities. Each of these businesses provide critical products supporting national infrastructure. To the extent practical, we continue to permit our employees in these segments to work remotely and as I've mentioned before, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities have implemented strict protocols to ensure employee health and safety, while at the workplace.\nIn late March, our AMES U.K. facilities were closed by government directive and our employees were directed to stay at home. By early June, we were able to reopen our facility there, which was ahead of our anticipated July resumption of operations. In Mexico, our ClosetMaid manufacturing facility that supports the U.S. and Canada sales closed for approximately 1.5 weeks in April, but has been operational since.\nTurning to our Defense Electronics business. Telephonics continues to operate at all of its sites as it provides critical manufacturing and services supporting the U.S. military and its operations are essential for maintaining our national security.\nLet's talk about the quarter and performance. In Consumer and Professional Products, we saw a strong third quarter demand for seasonal lawn and garden tools, storage and organizational solutions at major retailers and home centers across North America and in Australia. Upon reopening in June, there was strong U.K. demand for our product offerings as well. Our AMES strategic initiative remains on track and includes implementing an integrated business intelligence system, supporting all of our AMES operations, rationalizing our distribution and manufacturing facilities, and investing in automation and e-commerce capabilities.\nOur Home and Building Products segment revenue declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter. Strong residential sectional garage door sales, later in the quarter, almost completely offset the reduction in sales seen in the first part of the quarter. Sales in our commercial door business increased slightly in the quarter compared to the prior year.\nOperations at Telephonics have continued uninterrupted and Q3 revenue exceeded the prior year. The anticipated second tranche of bookings related to the Lockheed Martin MH60 Romeo foreign military sale program with India was funded and $49 million was booked to backlog in the quarter. Telephonics experienced some slowing from suppliers during Q3, which could slow certain customer deliveries and work performed in Q4.\nWe also are announcing today that we're evaluating strategic alternatives for the System Engineering Group, which we call SEG, which is a technical services subsidiary within our Defense Electronics segment, providing advanced simulation and analysis for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Missile Defense Agency. Telephonics' core business focus is on defense electronic systems, products, and systems. We believe that SEG would benefit from being part of a parent organization that is more focused on government technical services.\nAdditionally, we're cognizant of the government's Organizational Conflict of Interest called OCI standards, and believe that such a sale better aligns our businesses with those standards.\nSEG is well-run with a strong management team and annual revenues of approximately $30 million. The timing of this process is bolstered by SEG's recent $119 million award from the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division.\nThis is an opportunity for us to provide incremental value to Griffon shareholders, while also positioning SEG for enhanced growth with a suitable acquirer. We've already started the process to sell this business and we're working to get that done in the near future.\nLet's turn to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we continued to work on strengthening our balance sheet and positioning the company for future growth. In June, we issued an additional $150 million of senior notes as a tack-on to the 5.75% notes we issued in February 2020. We've now fully refinanced our $1 billion of 5.25% notes due in 2022 with 5.75% notes that have maturity in 2028. As a reminder, in January, we also extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to 2025 and expanded its borrowing capacity by $50 million to $400 million with an additional $100 million of availability through an accordion feature.\nWe've established a solid foundation for growing the company and we have ample liquidity to weather any near-term effects of the pandemic and other market uncertainty, while continuing to invest in all of our businesses.\nFinally, earlier today, our Board authorized a $0.075 per share dividend payable on September 17, 2020 to shareholders of record on August 20, 2020. This marks the 36th consecutive quarterly dividend to shareholders, which has grown at an annualized compound rate of 17% since we initiated it in 2012.\nLet me turn it over to Brian for a little closer look at some of the numbers. Brian?\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Ron. I'll start by highlighting our third quarter consolidated performance. Revenue increased 10% to $632 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $69 million, both in comparison to the prior year quarter. Normalized gross profit for the quarter was $165 million, increasing 6.8% over the prior-year quarter, while gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 26.1%.\nThird quarter selling, general and administrative expenses were $114 million including $1.6 million of charges related to the AMES strategic initiative. As a percentage of sale, SG&A, adjusted for the charges, decreased 280 basis points to 17.7%.\nThird quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $22 million or $0.50 per share compared to the prior-year period of $14 million or $0.33 per share. Excluding items that affect comparability from both periods, current quarter adjusted net income was $26 million or $0.59 a share compared to the prior year of $13 million or $0.31 per share.\nThe effective tax rate, excluding items that affect comparability for the quarter, was 30.8% and year-to-date was 32.6%. Capital spending was $12 million in the third quarter, in line with prior year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the third quarter.\nRegarding our segments, Consumer and Professional Products' third quarter revenue increased 20% to $329 million over the prior year quarter, driven by increased volume of 19%, propelled by customer demand for home improvement in North America and Australia, favorable price and mix of 1% and incremental revenue from the Apta acquisition was 2%, all partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2%. Organic growth was 18%.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $37 million, increasing 55% from the prior year quarter due to the increased revenue as mentioned a moment ago, partially offset by increased tariffs and COVID-19 related costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.3% compared to 8.8% in the prior year quarter. The AMES strategic initiative continues on plan and we expect to close our Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania and Falls City, Nebraska facilities by the end of the fiscal year.\nHome and Building Products' third quarter revenue decreased 1% to $219 million over the prior year quarter due primarily to decreased volume of residential sectional garage door orders in April, which were down 18%, but then had subsequent recovery in May and June. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16% to $39 million over the prior year quarter due to the benefits of general operating efficiency improvements, partially offset by the decrease in revenue and COVID-19 related inefficiencies and direct costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.9% in the quarter compared to 15.3% in the prior year quarter.\nDefense Electronics' third quarter revenue increased 5% to $84 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased deliveries and volume of radar and communication systems. Adjusted EBITDA during the period was $4 million compared to the prior year quarter of $7 million impacted by mix and program inefficiencies on radar and communication systems, as well as increased bid and proposal costs. Year-to-date backlog as of June 30, 2020 was $350 million, a $19 million increase from Q2. And we expect to continue to build backlog in the fourth quarter. Corporate and unallocated expenses, excluding depreciation, were $11 million in the third quarter.\nRegarding our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2020, we had $72 million in cash and total debt outstanding of $1.13 billion resulting in a net debt position of $1.06 billion and debt-to-EBITDA leverage of 4.4 times as calculated based on our debt covenants. This reflects one full turn of deleveraging from the prior year period. Borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was $274 million, subject to certain loan covenants.\nMoving to our fourth quarter and full-year outlook. Like many other companies, last quarter, we withdrew our guidance because of the uncertainties arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. We now have a clear picture of the effects of the pandemic's impact for this year. As a result, we are reinstating guidance for fiscal 2020. We normally give guidance once a year and do not update that guidance during the year and we plan to return to that policy. However, given the continued uncertainty resulting resulting from COVID-19, we felt it was appropriate for us to provide an update as an exception in this instance.\nWe are now providing guidance for the full year 2020 of approximately $2.3 billion in revenue and $270 million plus of adjusted EBITDA before unallocated expenses. Note that our overall guidance, even with the conservative Q4 outlook, is higher than our original guidance for the year of $250 million plus of adjusted EBITDA before unallocated expenses that we provided back in November. Further, our full year fiscal 2020 guidance includes approximately $60 million for capital expenditures, $64 million for depreciation and amortization, $65 million for net interest expense and $45 million for unallocated expenses, with all of these remaining the same as originally communicated during our November 2019 earnings call.\nNow, I'll turn the call back over to Ron.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Brian. Griffon's year-to-date performance is something we are all collectively very proud of. Considering how much we've achieved in just a few short years since we began this portfolio repositioning, it's especially gratifying. At the time we announced it, we discussed the opportunities for top-line growth and margin expansion through the realization of efficiencies during the integration process of all of our acquired companies. Further, we expect it to become stronger competitively by providing increased value to our customers in terms of our broader product offering, improved service levels, and enhanced efficiency. We continue to believe the diversity of our businesses, our emphasis on domestic manufacturing, and our focus on the leading brands provides a strong foundation for future growth. This quarter in particular brings into focus what our repositioned portfolio can accomplish and the potential upside of following our strategy.\nGriffon's performance has been excellent and we believe there is still considerable opportunity for improving the performance of our businesses. In addition, we remain committed to finding strategic acquisitions that expand and strengthen our product portfolio within our home markets. We're getting closer to our objective of 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA leverage, our free cash flow has and will continue to improve and we expect to see our leverage to continue to decline further, as we execute our business plan.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our workforce, which has shown exceptional dedication and perseverance throughout this challenging period. We appreciate the importance of their work in order to deliver these excellent results.\nOperator, we'll take any questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nCertainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick of CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nBob Labick\u00a0--\u00a0CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGood afternoon and congratulations on some terrific results.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Bob.\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Bob.\nBob Labick\u00a0--\u00a0CJS Securities -- Analyst\nYeah. So I wanted to start obviously particularly in CPP, just outstanding demand. How do you -- I guess, how long do you think this can last and how do you position your products and brands to get more attention and to become repeat purchases and replacement purchases and what do you need to do with this increased focus on your products to fulfill the demand that's out there?\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I'll start by reminding you that we were having a very good year going into COVID and the strength of our brands, the demand for our product was already ahead of expectations and certainly ahead of last year going into this pandemic. The structural changes that we clearly are seeing of how people are purchasing the types of products that we provide is -- had been moving to a way far more deliberate e-commerce-supported model, and that includes web searching as well as brick and mortar retail and online purchasing. And our strategy has been, for some time, that we're going to be the leading brands and the best products in every product that we sell. That was the story around AMES, that was the story around us buying ClosetMaid and then fitting it into AMES. So the strategy was clearly working. What happened with the stay-at-home is things are accelerating. And there is clearly an economy that's functioning quite well even during this incredibly difficult time.\nIt's not lost on us that we're at record unemployment, It's not lost on us that we're in a recession and yet our business trends are not only surviving, they're prospering. So that result of being at home we view as, it was working going into this, accelerating during it, and are -- the back-end of your question is what we've been doing in terms of investing in the business. The AMES strategic initiative that we had announced in November was about the future for the company about being able to expand our distribution capability, expand our product offerings. We are believers in brands, we're builders of brands, we've bought companies in every product category. We're at the early stages of what we view as the AMES growth initiative. And what you see in this quarter is clearly a very robust demand. At the same time, aside of operating efficiencies that were already in place, driving increased performance. So our plan going forward is to continue to do exactly what we have been doing in building the brands and supporting the best retailers, both brick and mortar and online for every product that we sell.\nBob Labick\u00a0--\u00a0CJS Securities -- Analyst\nOkay, that's great, very helpful. And then, shifting over to Telephonics, the international is coming on and margins were a little late, I guess, in the quarter. How do you see -- is this year kind of the trough? Can we see some growth adjusting for the SEG, the potential strategic alternatives as you said? And so, how do you kind of look at the next 12 to 24 months on the Telephonics side?\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. We've talked about for some time that the Telephonics business was bottoming. We view that process as having played out as we expected. COVID clearly has had an impact on timing of orders, but the demand for the core surveillance and reconnaissance products, particularly radar systems, we continue to see the backlog improving. We expect that to showcase itself in the fourth quarter. The sale of SEG is the conclusion of what's been a very nice piece of Telephonics and the story behind it is we bought it in 2005, we've built it up, the sale of it is really about three things. One, it allows us to focus on the core of what Telephonics does. It should be a margin improvement story prospectively for us and it will be a small but meaningful additional part of our deleveraging story. So it's a gain. It's a business that we have built and the harvesting of it is part of our broader strategy of continuing to grow the core of Telephonics.\nBob Labick\u00a0--\u00a0CJS Securities -- Analyst\nSuper. Congrats again on the quarter.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nI appreciate it.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Julio Romero of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nJulio Romero\u00a0--\u00a0Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nHey, good afternoon.\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHi, Julio.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Julio.\nJulio Romero\u00a0--\u00a0Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nSo on CPP, the strength you're seeing there, can you give us a little more granularity on what products are leading that growth? I know, you've got a very diverse portfolio and you called out outdoor lawn and garden, but you've also got some indoor lines like ClosetMaid, that I assume would have also done well, given everyone's kind of cooped up indoors. So I was hoping you could give us some specific examples of some product lines that are kind of leading that growth.\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So, you sort of hit it. We have seen growth in demand of -- in both lawn and garden and the home organization side. Home organization is a -- pretty much a do-it-yourself type item where people can buy the products either at a store or online and install it. Home and garden, of course, is something that's done mostly outside and we are seeing people using their time at home and the fact that they're not spending on other things such as travel or going to restaurants and investing in their homes. And generally speaking, our products are at price points that are affordable. They're not very large ticket items. And that's what's been driving some of that demand.\nJulio Romero\u00a0--\u00a0Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nGot it. And could you talk about maybe the sequential trend in CPP? Maybe how that business performed in May and June, and maybe give us a sense of how trends and fill rates are quarter-to-date?\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nWe continue to see...\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nWe continue to see trends improving. The stabilization had happened after the last time we spoke, which was late April, went into May, accelerated into the end of the quarter and continues into July. We expect this is going to continue: the market share gains of the products that we provide, the domestic manufacturingand distribution, and we've been talking for several years that this focus of ours on being able to support the biggest providers of all the products, it's clear that the supply chains are moving to domestically sourced product. We are the leading product, leading market share in every major product category that we sell and we're going to continue to invest in the brands to make sure that we get increased market share as we go forward.\nJulio Romero\u00a0--\u00a0Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nGot it. And you saw a really nice rebound on the residential garage door side. I remember last quarter you called out some customer hesitancy on the retail side, individuals kind of didn't want to stand in line at major home centers. Do you think there has been more of a change in customer behavior since April or was it more like the dealer side that drove that growth?\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo, yes, correct. We saw a decline in April. Our orders in April were down 18%, mostly being driven by home centers, retail type sales, with some decline in the dealers. As we progressed into May, sales started to normalize on all those channels and then come June and into July, sales accelerated quite well. And the commercial side saw good and normal volume and sales through the entire period.\nJulio Romero\u00a0--\u00a0Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nGot it. So across the board, kind of, dealer and retail did well in June.\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, June and continued into July.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd we continue to see that trending up. The other point that I'll just make is the commercial side of the business is doing well. We bought CornellCookson, we had talked about the ability to provide the rolling steel doors as part of the warehouse business that was going to grow. Retail was going to continue to go through a transformation. The security part of our business, we're the leading manufacturer of a series of security doors, which is called the Defender Series, continues to show growth. The civil unrest that's going on around the country has actually spurred a level of demand in that business. The Clopay business was already the leading residential manufacturer. Owning CornellCookson gives us a leverage and we're at the early days of the integration of that business, obviously very gratifying to see the recovery from April residentially into May and it's, in our view, a reflection of the stay-at-home trends that are gone.\nJulio Romero\u00a0--\u00a0Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nGreat. Very nice job, everyone. I'll hop back in the queue.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nWe appreciate it, thanks.\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, OK.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Wojs\u00a0--\u00a0Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nHey, gentlemen, good afternoon. Nice job.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Tim.\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Tim. How are you doing?\nTimothy Wojs\u00a0--\u00a0Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nGood, good, thanks. I guess my first question, just curious on channel inventory, particularly in CPP. How would you characterize that relative to normal? We're hearing some of the categories are pretty tight just in terms of the level of demand, kind of, in May and June and into July. So I'm just curious how you'd characterize some of your partners' channel inventories within your categories?\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nI think that...\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo we have actually -- I didn't mean to speak over you, so we have actually seen good demand for our products as we've already discussed. We have been able to service our customers very well. Our domestic manufacturing capability has really benefited us compared to others. So when major home centers need products, we are able to provide it to them or when any other home center or retail are needed. So we have adequate inventory and adequate manufacturing capability to continue to provide those products.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nI think...\nTimothy Wojs\u00a0--\u00a0Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nOkay.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nI think, in general, the inventory levels that we're seeing across -- and remember we service all of the major retailers from Home Depot to Lowe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to Menards, the national hardware chains, the mass retailers. This is a trend that we continue to see that they're ordering more.\nTimothy Wojs\u00a0--\u00a0Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nOkay. Okay. And then as you think of the strategic initiatives, could you just talk about kind of where you're at on the process there and just has the pandemic, through the quarter, had any impact on the timing or are you guys ahead or kind of on track there?\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nI think we're...\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe continue to be on track. It's a three-year plan. Things are going on as planned, on budget, on time. Nothing has slowed down from the pandemic.\nTimothy Wojs\u00a0--\u00a0Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And then the free cash flow performance in the quarter was really good. How should we think about free cash flow maybe in the fourth quarter? Should you also have a pretty good quarter, just given the demand strength you've seen?\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So, our second half of the year, that's our Q3 that we just ended, and our Q4 is our strongest cash flow months, cash generation quarters, I should say. And we continue to expect to increase cash flow into the fourth quarter.\nTimothy Wojs\u00a0--\u00a0Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. Nice work on the quarter and good luck on the rest of the year, guys.\nRonald J. Kramer\u00a0--\u00a0Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Tim.\nBrian G. Harris\u00a0--\u00a0Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks,Tim.\nOperator\nThis concludes the question-and-answer session.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.\nTina Correia -- Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\nThank you, operator. Thank you and good afternoon everyone, welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are: Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the September 2019 quarter and our outlook for the December 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 o'clock PM Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.\nToday;s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 o'clock PM Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.\nWith that, let me hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Tina, and welcome everyone. In the September quarter Lam delivered solid results. Our continued execution to commitments combined with our guidance for the December quarter increases our conviction, that Lam is in a strong position to outperform as wafer fabrication equipment spending inflects higher. Doug will cover the financial results in more detail shortly, but I am especially pleased with the demonstrated earnings power of the company.\nAt the midpoint of our December guide calendar year 2019 diluted earnings per share will be the second highest in our history. Despite the current industry cycle. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and partners for their continued support of Lam, and our employees throughout the world for their contributions to these results.\nFrom an industry perspective, we have revised upward our view on 2019 WFE to the mid-$40 billion range versus our prior estimate of down mid to high teens percentage year-on-year, which implied a low $40 billion level of spending. We are beginning to see improvement in the memory market, led first by NAND. NAND demand dynamics are improving and oversupply conditions should continue to abate as we move through the December quarter. We expect to exit 2019 with a bit supply growth rate for NAND of approximately 30%, which is well below our view on long-term demand. And as a result, NAND inventories are expected to decline to normalized levels in the first half of calendar 2020.\nWhile the timing of a memory equipment spending recovery is always hard to predict. We are encouraged that customers continue to manage supply growth even as we are starting to see favorable end market demand indicators. This is a sign of a healthy industry and a good set up for increased NAND spending in 2020.\nOn the DRAM front inventories have remained elevated and we do not expect them to reach normalized levels until the second half of 2020. However, we see positive demand catalysts ahead in both the server and smartphone markets. A server CPU upgrade cycle is expected to begin next year with increased adoption of new generation platforms from leading manufacturers. For smartphones major vendors are planning to launch additional 5G models, which is expected to drive content growth for the overall smartphone market in 2020.\nTurning to foundry and logic, spending in this segment has been strong throughout 2019 and based on recent customer commentary looks to remain so heading into next year. Diverse end market applications are driving higher levels of foundry and logic spending. Moreover challenges in scaling functional blocks such as; SRAM in logic devices are leading to increases in die sizes and these in turn are accelerating changes in device architectures and chip manufacturing technologies.\nLams growing position with key foundry and logic customers has positioned us to incrementally benefit from these secular trends. Competitively, we are executing at a high level. Based on the midpoint of our December guidance Lams 2019 foundry and logic revenues are set to significantly outgrow announced customer capex plans. The share gains we are now seeing in the foundry and logic segment are the result of close customer collaboration and strong product execution over many years and multiple technology transitions. They are evidence of the benefit of sustained investment in R&D throughout industry cycles.\nLooking at the market as a whole, including memory, foundry and logic, we are on track in 2019 to deliver our best ever penetration and defense performance, as measured by net forward-looking three-year revenue opportunity for application decisions made in this calendar year. A key contributor to our strong penetration and defense performance has been continued focus on technologies that enable 3D device architectures, which are becoming increasingly important to performance and cost scaling across all market segments. We invested early in 2D to 3D inflections and as these transitions are occurring we are seeing expansion in both our SAM and market share.\nEtch and deposition processes are critical enablers for 3D scaling, and we are investing aggressively to deliver the technology and productivity innovation required to satisfy customer roadmaps. As evidenced by our penetration and defense wins this year, we believe we are extending Lams leadership in this space.\nIn 3D NAND, we have successfully defended 100% of our memory whole dielectric etch positions and continue to be the supplier for this application at all 3D NAND manufacturers. We are also winning 3D NAND applications where productivity is the primary point of differentiation. Notably, Lam, has been the first to deliver production-proven edge yield solutions for etch. In this quarter, we used our Corvus tunable edge hardware on our flex dielectric etch system to improve profile tilt uniformity and win an important productivity sensitive slit etch application.\nOn the conductor etch front, we want to 3D NAND application for a new vertical architecture that reduces die size and is a technical solution for lowering bit cost. In deposition, we recorded an important 3D NAND win for the VECTOR DT, which deposits backside films to control stress as layer counts increase. Another significant deposition win was for our striker ALD tool used to deposit high quality liners and gap fill as aspect ratios get higher.\nWe also continued to extend our 3D expertise and position outside of the 3D NAND space, including in rapidly growing markets such as; advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration. Over the last three years, the installed base for our SABRE 3D electroplating system has grown by more than 70%, and we are the leading electroplating supplier for TSV for DRAM, CMOS image sensor and logic devices. Our SABRE 3D electroplating solutions embed best-in-class technology, backed by years of high-volume production experience.\nWith each successive win across our served markets, the installed base of Lam equipment continues to grow. Resulting in an expanding long-term revenue opportunity for our customer support business. To create value for customers over the entire life cycle of tool ownership, we are actively developing upgrades and advanced services, targeted extending technical capability and increasing productivity from existing installed base assets. These offerings help our customers reduce their total cost. And as a result, we continue to see growing demand.\nRevenues from our customer support business grew in the September quarter on a sequential basis and our Reliant business achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row. We expect 2019 overall will be another growth year for our customer support business.\nLooking at our year-to-date performance. We have made tremendous progress against our objectives of expanding our SAM, increasing our market share and building our installed base business. Importantly 2019 has been a year where Lam has strengthened its position in the foundry and logic segment. Also with early indications of improving NAND demand and positive catalysts on the horizon for DRAM, we are increasingly optimistic that calendar year 2020 is setting up to be a year of outperformance for Lam, as spending mix boost back in our favor.\nThanks again for joining today and now here's Doug.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOkay, great. Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. And what I know is a busy earnings season. We're pleased with Lam's performance in the September quarter. Our results once again exceeded the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics. Operating income and diluted earnings per share came in at the high-end of our guidance range, as we remained prudent in managing our spending throughout the quarter.\nLet me begin as I always do by talking about our revenue segmentation in the September quarter. The combined memory segment was flat with the June quarter at 64% of total systems revenue. We had a decrease in the September quarter in the non-volatile memory segment moving from 46% to 38%, while DRAM increased to 26% from 18% of systems revenue. Spending in the NAND segment was focused on multiple nodes and we're beginning to see the first ramp of 128 layer structures.\nOn the DRAM side apart from the 1X and 1y nodes. We are seeing initial investments at 1z. As I noted in our last quarter earnings call, foundry and logic spending was strong and we expect strength from this segment to continue through the remainder of the calendar year. The foundry segment represented 25% of our systems revenue in the quarter. Strength in this segment is related to spending on the 7 and 5-nanometer nodes.\nWhile logic and other segment was down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 11% of system revenue. We've continued to demonstrate strong progress in the foundry and logic segments, enabling us to maintain solid profitability levels during a period of depressed memory spending. I believe foundry and logic spending will be even stronger in December.\nRevenues for the quarter came in at $2,166 million, which was again above the midpoint of guidance. While revenue had a slightly broader geographic mix in the September quarter, compared to the June quarter. Our top regions continue to be China, Korea and Taiwan. The China region quarter performance remains higher than our historic average concentration of revenue. And similar to what I talked about last quarter, the majority of this came from indigenous Chinese customers across multiple segments.\nGross margin came in at 45.4%, which was 40 basis points above the midpoint, mainly due to customer mix. And as we've stated in prior quarters, you should expect gross margins to be a function of several factors such as; business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and we expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter. We continue to manage our spending levels in the company, as operating expenses in the September quarter declined to $431 million, which was down from $450 million in the previous quarter. We remain laser focused on investing in research and development programs. As we saw the percentage of spending in R&D increased quarter-over-quarter to 67% of operating expenses.\nIn the December quarter, the guidance reflects total spending increasing back to the June level, primarily doing -- due to an increase in variable compensation expense. Our variable compensation fluctuates based on the level of quarterly profitability. But also remind you that as we look ahead to the 2020 calendar year, you will see the normal seasonal spending increases related to the March quarter, comes from things like payroll taxes. Operating income in the September quarter was $552 million and operating margin was 25.5% at the top of our guidance range.\nOur September quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 11%, which was slightly lower than our long-term rate. There will be fluctuations in the rate from quarter-to-quarter, and we now expect our long-term rate to be in the low teens level.\nOther income and expense was a total of approximately $11 million in expense in the September quarter. The main components of other income and expense our interest income from the cash and investment balances we hold, offset by expense related to our outstanding debt. The total interest expense and all tranches of our debt is right now about $41 million per quarter. You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, based on several market related items such as; our deferred compensation assets, venture capital investments and foreign exchange.\nWe continue to execute on our capital return program during the September quarter. We allocated $234 million to capital return in the quarter with $75 million related to open market share repurchases and $159 million in dividends. I would like to remind you that we continue to have an ongoing structured repurchase program that is expected to mature in the December quarter. This will continue to reduce our share count. We remain on track with our committed capital return. We currently have approximately $3 billion remaining in our Board authorized share repurchase program.\nDiluted earnings per share came in at $3.18, which was at the high end of the guidance range that we provided for September. We ended the September quarter with diluted shares for earnings per share at approximately 151 million shares, which is the seventh consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.\nLet me now switch to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased slightly in the September quarter to $5.8 billion from $5.7 billion in the June quarter. Cash flows from operations were $464 million, which was offset by share repurchase and dividends. Year-to-date in calendar year 2019, we have had strong cash from operations performance and we're on track to end this year with the second highest level of free cash flows in the company's history.\nDSO increased to 69 days versus 56 in the prior quarter. The DSO increase is related to the timing of customer payments occurring at the end of the September calendar month, which falls within our December fiscal quarter. Our inventory balance declined sequentially by $57 million, which is the fifth consecutive quarter where inventory balance decline. Inventory turns were 3.2 turns, which was just a little bit less than the 3.3 turns that we saw in the June quarter.\nNon-cash expenses included approximately $43 million for equity compensation, $49 million for depreciation and $16 million for amortization. September quarter capital expenditures came in at $39 million, which was a decrease from $66 million in the June quarter. Our September quarter-end headcount was flat with the prior quarter at approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees.\nSo now looking ahead I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2019 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2,500 million, plus or minus $150 million. Gross margin of 45% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating margins of 27% plus or minus 1 percentage point.\nAnd finally, earnings per share of $3.80 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 150 million shares. I'm pleased to share with you the results we've delivered throughout calendar year 2019 and what has been a challenging industry environment. As Tim noted the supply demand environment is improving for the memory segments and we've made good progress in our foundry and logic positioning. Our installed base business continues to be on track to deliver a growth year in 2019. We're well positioned heading into 2020 and are optimistic about our future performance going forward.\nFinally, I'd like to announce our plans to host an Investor Day on March 3rd, 2020 in New York City. Details on the venue and precise time will be forthcoming.\nOperator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst\nHi, thanks for taking my question and good job on the execution. Question on the WFE, Tim, you mentioned WFE going from low $40 billion to mid $40 billion. I want to spend, if the majority of the increase has come from the foundry\/logic segment in terms of the revised outlook?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe a few modifications, I mean, clearly, as we've said, we've continued to see strengthening in foundry and logic. So that is a portion of it. The -- some very early indications of NAND spending increase as we now guided for December quarter. And finally, continuing strengthening in the China WFE as we've, kind of, seen increased strength throughout the year. So combination of all those things lead to our upward revision in WFE.\nAtif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst\nOkay. And then just a follow-up in your prepared remarks, you mentioned foundry\/logic share gains above foundry\/logic capex this year. How should we think about the outperformance of your foundry\/logic business into next year and out given that some of the elements like reuse and growing EUV steps?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, that's a great question, we basically -- as we have said on a number of occasions, the intensity of etch and deposition we see continuing increase at every technology node. Our SAM grows, whether it'd be 10 to seven to five to three on into the future. SAM increases even in the face of EUV increased usage. And there's a number of reasons for that; patterning complexity continues to increase regardless of the introduction of EUV, and so there are additional steps for deposition and etch.\nEUV itself introduces new requirements for hardmasks, which gives Lam opportunity to participate from a deposition perspective. And EUV also, we have talked about in the past introduces opportunities for new steps like end processes like atomic layer etching that can be used to help increase quality and productivity of the EUV pattern itself. So I think the way you should think about it is our SAM is expanding, competitively our -- we're gaining share at some of these new layers and we feel we're well set up in both the foundry and logic space going forward as technology transitions.\nAtif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst\nThanks.\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Atif.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll now take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nYes. Good afternoon thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, if we look back to 2018, it looks like your share of wallet in -- for WFE with NAND it's roughly 30%. So curious as you think about moving to a rising layer count and your leadership in high aspect ratio etch and the just announced deposition wins on the call tonight. How should we think about your share of wallet as we go to 128 layer and above into 2020?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOur SAM as a percentage of customer spend continues to increase with layer count and that's for two reasons; one, I mean obviously the simple fact of building and etching the higher stack, but also the fact that, as I mentioned there are new steps and new opportunities that created for dealing with issues such as; in the VECTOR DT case distress associated with those taller layer counts. So I think that our view is SAM grows as layer count increases.\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThanks, Tim. And I guess as a follow-up, Doug, I'm not sure if you spoke to the entirety of installed base revenues, but did they grow sequentially in September? And how should we think about the trend? Or what should we kind of model it to -- into 2020?\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. C.J., I think, Tim, actually mentioned in his prepared remarks that they did grow sequentially and it was the third consecutive record quarter for the Reliant component of that business. I'm not going to quantify next year yet, a little bit too soon. But what we said in the past and I continue to be very comfortable saying today is, I have a hard time envisioning a year when the installed base business doesn't grow, it should grow every single year. Because chamber count grows every year, it's growing this year, even in a depressed memory spending environment and we continue to bring new advanced service offerings to market that we hope enable us to achieve more and more of the customer's opex spend. So that's how you should be thinking about that C.J.\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks so much.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, C.J.\nOperator\nThank you. We will now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nGood afternoon, great job on the quarterly execution. This is second quarter in a row of the heavier China domestic mix. Do you guys anticipate this bias to continue into the December quarter and into next year and similar to my question last time? Is this in your view a focused effort by China to accelerate their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, given the trade tensions with the US or more your China customers just having more confidence to move forward with their early memory and foundry programs?\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Harlan, what I tried to describe in fact, I'm trying to fore shadow with last quarter in earnings that this is above normal run rate of local Chinese customers spend. But Tim did point out in his remarks, that some of the strengthening in WFE came from local China probably now and nominally somewhat above $6 billion in WFE. And as we look into next year we absolutely think it will grow again next year, but it will ebb and flow, it will -- these big projects can be lumpy at times, and it will go up and it will go down depending on when equipment ships into any one fab projects. Tim, you want to add anything?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think that -- as I commented, we've seen strengthening in domestic China spend through the year. Anticipate that continuing and maybe the most important part of that story for Lam is that clearly a big portion of the new incremental spending in China is targeted toward the memory market. And obviously our SAM, and our share in the memory space is quite good, so from that perspective we see China is area of strength for us.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Harlan, I forgot the one part of your question you asked, do we think anything pulled in? Actually really don't, I don't think it would make sense that they would be pulling things in sooner and because if you're concerned about our inability to ship being the reason they pulled in, then they can get spares and service from us, they can't actually really utilize the tools very well. So I don't believe that there was pull-ons really do anything like that.\nHarlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you. Thank you for the insights there. And the team continues its strong design win momentum on non-critical and\/or legacy technology node. As part of it, as you pointed out is the Reliant systems products continue to do well. We continue to hear from your customers that they're laser focused on productivity throughput, uptime, footprint all of the things that impact overall wafer costs. Are you guys now in a position to at least give us some sense on how fast the non-critical\/refurbished business systems -- business is growing? And roughly the size of this business relative to your total revenue base?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe you have to wait till Investor Day for that. No, we do plan -- we do -- we have promised for some time now to provide you more detail in those areas and we're just, we will do that. I think maybe a couple of points, your comment about customers being laser focused on productivity? I mean, it's one of the reasons why we have been talking about it, it takes some time for those products for our efforts to really start to show up in new wins, but you know we're starting to see in this area that Doug talked about in advanced services, where some of these intelligent database tools are really starting to help us reduce, for instance troubleshooting time on the systems, reduced unscheduled downs on the systems and those are things that the customers are pulling hard for because again it's productivity for tools that are already in place and relatively easy to implement. So we are prioritizing productivity, because it's in the best interest of the customer and the industry as a whole.\nHarlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nYes, thank you.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Harlan.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll hear now from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nYeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks, let me ask the question. Congratulations on the strong results. Tim, I just want to go back to the market opportunity in logic\/foundry for you. If you kind of look at calendar year-to-date that business combined for you was up somewhere between 30% to 40% year-over-year? I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of how we think about your market position, maybe in North America as we see 14 go to 10 go to seven and maybe in Taiwan as we see seven go to five go to three, can you talk a little bit about how much visibility you have on product tool of record on some of these critical etch and deposition steps? And how we might think about your share opportunity as we migrate down these nodes?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, I can do that without quite getting as specific as North America, Taiwan on those notes. So maybe I'll point you just a couple of comments, I made in [Indecipherable] there was a little bit, you know, as I said it within the logic and foundry space, it takes many years to establish yourself as the first -- the development tool of record. And then ultimately see that rollout into volume buys is the production tool of record. And so when we talk about I gave -- we gave a little bit of a new look into this penetration and defense. Forward-looking three-year revenue opportunity statement, that is designed to give some indication as to how long it takes from the time we win one of those selection decisions and you'll see that revenue opportunity will take place over those following three years, that's definitely true in the foundry and logic space.\nAnd so I think that when we talk about improving opportunity at 10 and then seven and then five, you know, you can kind of look out and say, if you're like a 5-nanometer decision is revenue opportunities that now we're roll in over the course of the next several years. So that may not be quite the level of specificity you wanted, but it basically says things that we are winning now will actually be our revenue for the next three years plus in that space.\nJohn Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And then, Doug, you mentioned in your prepared comments, you still have about $3 billion left on the buyback, and I apologize in capital allocation call, but this most recent quarter, the buybacks dipped down a little bit, which I guess is understandable, just given the level of uncertainty. Any color you can give us around the pace at which you might want to try to execute buybacks going forward? And how we should think about, kind of, just remind us again the cash return policy you're trying to hit?\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, John, I mean, one thing I would point out to you and if you look over the last two years, you will have seen several quarters where the cash we actually deployed moved down somewhat. That was because in the quarter before that we put one of these accelerated share repurchase programs in place. You have the same phenomenon going on this quarter. So even though the cash that we deployed in terms of open market repurchases wasn't all that significant this quarter, that ASR was still executing buying stock back, and that ASR that's currently out there will complete in the December quarter. So we'll be thinking about what we're going to do incrementally as we go forward.\nSo far, just remind you what we talked about and it's been a while now the last Analyst Day that we're committed to at least 50% of free cash flow returned to shareholders, and obviously if you look at our history, over the last five, six years, we've done a whole lot more than that. And I had went on the timing to complete the current authorization and I'm going to kind of remain that way. I've said in the past, we'll be opportunistic and that's as much as I have quite right now.\nJohn Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thanks, guys, congratulations.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, John.\nOperator\nThank you, we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\nThanks a lot. I guess my first question, Doug is can you help us a little bit with the mix in December. I'm curious, if the uptick in revenue is going to be more on the NAND side and more on the foundry side? Thanks.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, what I said, Tim in my remarks, was I expect December will continue to be pretty strong with foundry and logic quarter. So that's a key piece of what's going on.\nTimothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\nOkay, awesome. And then I just wanted to -- I just wanted to drill down a little bit into the China piece. So China is about 25% of your revenues now on the trailing 12-month basis. So I guess, I'm curious how much of this is going into indigenous projects versus the multinationals. Because I thought you said China was about $5 billion of 2018 WFE, and I think at that time, you were talking about $3 billion of that $5 billion being domestic China. And I think you just said that China is going to be over $6 this year. So can you sort of like level set us on how much of that $6 this year will be multi-versus domestic and maybe how much domestic can even grow next year? Thanks.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, let me walk it back for you a little, Tim, because some things have moved around a little bit. When I look at what happened last year, local China ended up being I don't know $4.5 billion of WFE roughly. So it ended up being maybe a little bit more than that for that we have been talking about and the way we see it today, it's above $6, it's somewhat above $6. I don't know for sure what next year is going to look like. But as we look at our analytics in the fab projects that are coming in and whatnot. I do see pretty strongly believe it will grow next year. I'm not ready to tell you how much yet. We'll give you more clarity on our WFE view for next year on the next earnings call. But I think local China will continue to grow next year.\nTimothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\nAnd, Doug just to clarify those numbers are local China numbers right?\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThat's right, Tim. Yes.\nTimothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\nOkay. Awesome, thanks so much.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. You're welcome.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll take the next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nYes. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Tim, you talked about early signs of a recovery in NAND in your prepared remarks. And Doug, you just mentioned that most of the growth or at least implicitly, I think you commented that most of the growth in December quarter should be coming from foundry and logic? So should we expect some of the NAND projects that we're all collectively hearing about should hit the March quarter from a rev rec perspective?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, it's maybe there is not such a big change here from what we've said. We -- you know, ever since beginning of the year, we said that memory spending would likely remain relatively weak throughout the year. And when I talked about early signs, it is the -- it's very early is in there, we're now starting to see some of those projects transpire as you just talked about, meaning a little bit of ordering occurring in the December quarter, but we still maintain our view that we exit the year with this 30% bit supply growth rate and that customers are prudently managing the supply growth, but I do think those projects, you know, it's kind of that early signs, it's a healthy industry and we're going to see growth in 2020. So exact timing, we really don't want to give you that right now, but it's -- it looks to be coming.\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGot it. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to hit the logic and foundry opportunity dynamic into 2020. Obviously, you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years and gaining share in both buckets. If we assume that spending in logic and foundry is largely flat in 2020, and if you assume EUV adoption continues to grow. Based on what you guys know from a design win or application win perspective, can you still grow logic and foundry revenues in that sort of environment backdrop? Thanks.\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, it's a great question and the answer is yes, we would expect to grow in that scenario, based on a couple of things; one, as you move forward, even on the same WFE, our SAM as a percent of that WFE should increase as transition still continued to occur to more advanced nodes. Etch and deposition opportunity increases at each successive technology node, even in the face of EUV. So I think in the scenario described, we would expect to have a larger opportunity and we do believe that we're winning share as well and therefore we would grow.\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks so much.\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Toshiya.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll hear now from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nYes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them; first one for either Tim or Doug. More a industry focused question you spoke about how NAND bit growth exiting this year is going to be 30%, kind of, curious like ask your customers start ramping 128 layer NAND, if next year demand bit growth is below 30%. Do you still expect the 120 layers spending to go through next year, because it's more strategic, low cost in nature? Or do you think it might get throttle back if demand bit growth is slower?\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nMaybe I'll take and then Tim you can add-on. I mean, Krish what -- one I don't think that's what's going to happen. But we're that to be what happened, I think you would see a year that looked something like this year in that most of the industry spending was allocated to node conversions as opposed to new capacity adds, because that lowers cost per bit, the economics are better and all of that.\nThe other thing I would say, and then I'll let Tim add-on. When we look into early next year, I believe supply growth rate will continue to decline based on the investment set have occurred this year, right? Because they have reduced this year and so you're moving into a declining rate of growth, as we look into the first half of next year. Tim, anything you want to add?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think just to reiterate Doug's point, I mean, technology transitions we think occur every year, simply because of the benefit to bit cost. And so, I guess, I would say that in any year, which is not our view of declining supply growth we would still see the majority of the spend in technology transitions. And I guess there is one other key point to think about, we've mentioned this a few times in a technology transition from say 96 layers to 128 layers, the majority of that spend is for etch and deposition. So there's definitely an outperformance statement there, if spend continues to be based just on technology transitions.\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGot it, got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, I think, Tim in your prepared comments you spoke about how you guys are successfully defended 100% dielectric etch market share. I'm kind of curious on the NAND side, is that a fair enough statement, if you look past 128 layer higher than 128 layer DTOR tools or is it more up to 128 layers?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, in our statement is always as those decisions are made. So we always speak about accomplishing made. So I don't know if any decisions have been made well beyond the 128 layer node. So we -- it's obviously something that we compete for it every node. But, I guess what I'd point out is there is a very important piece of learning that has come from us running now millions of wafers through our dielectric etch tools. And there was a question earlier about, productivity, reliability, stability, defect performance. Those are all things that again we have millions and millions of wafers of experience. And so kind of come in with an edge every node that you have to compete for as the incumbent. So that -- but specifically, I think, you could bucket most of those in that 128 nanometer and below node since their decisions already made.\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug.\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Krish.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll hear from Patrick Ho with Stifel.\nPatrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst\nThank you very much. And also congrats on a really nice quarter. Maybe, Tim, first, a lot of the market questions have been answered on my end. But as you look at next generation memory technologies like MRAM, ReRAM. Can you just give a -- maybe a qualitative view of how Lam is positioning itself to capitalize on those next generation opportunities?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I guess maybe the simpler statement that I make inside the company is we're not running from our leadership position in memory, and that includes in these new emerging memory markets. And so we're actively looking to develop new applications, new tools that meet the needs of those devices. We've spoken about, one of them in particular so far this year, which is the ion beam edge tool, that's used for MRAM and we have established a very strong position for that particular application, phase-change memory ReRAM, there are other devices we are actively engaged in development with the leading companies. So it is a target market for us, in fact, one might argue that we feel we, sort of, we already sort of own that memory space and I think it's our focus.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIt's Dough [Phonetic] just to add-on, if you really want more detail you can go look at the transcript of the Flash Memory Summit, where Tim and Rick Gottscho spent lots of time talking about how we view these emerging memory architectures.\nPatrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. And maybe as my follow-up question, you talked a little bit about your atomic layer deposition opportunity. I guess from a big picture perspective, how do you see the total available market for you in that? And do you see it expanding from where -- it looks like you have a strong position on the memory side of thing. Can this also expand onto the foundry\/logic side of things?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo we'd already has expanded, I mean, ALD is not memory specific. So we use these films also on the logic and foundry side. ALD atomic layer etching and atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching, these are technologies that will continue to be increasingly used as devices become smaller and smaller and structures become more complex. So I think it's an expanding market opportunity, and in fact I think in coming years, you'll start to see inflections for instance from batch processing tools to single wafer ALD just again for the type of wafer uniformity and requirements of those processes going forward. So it's an area where we're growing and we feel confident about our development activities in the tools themselves.\nPatrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Patrick.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.\nCraig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I wanted to follow-up on the comments that you made that calendar '20 to be a year of outperformance for Lam. Can you just help us understand how much of that comes from moving deeper into the sweet spot of the foundry\/logic share gain that you've been talking about versus help that you would get from what appears to be a nice and very encouraging upturn that's starting to occur in NAND or maybe something else like SAM expansion?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think for us to give you more detail on the break out on that you'll have to wait until we actually speak to our 2020 WFE outlook next quarter. But you kind of hit it, I mean, we -- the way I think about outperformance in 2020, it's just what you said. First and foremost you -- everyone knows that we are highly leveraged to the memory market, and we do believe that spending mix moves back in our favor next year. And even in the face of stronger and continuing strength in logic and foundry memory will improve to some extent. We've strengthened our logic and foundry SAM opportunity, as well as share position and so that's a continued benefit as logic and foundry remain strong. And also as Doug mentioned CSBG continues to grow as we expand our portfolio of advanced services in that space. And so can break it out for you, how much each of those contributes, but each of them is important part of the story in 2020.\nCraig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst\nThanks, Tim. And then I'll do the follow-up to Doug. Doug impressive trough-to-trough operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points. And within that there is dramatic improvement with operating expense as a percentage of sales. And as you noted, there's been significant mix shift R&D. The question is how much further benefit is there in the model for increased operating leverage? And how much room do you have to further drive expense toward R&D from SG&A?\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIt's something we've been working on for years, I mean, Tim was driving those on years ago, honestly in rest of companies rally behind it. We're going to keep squeeze in efficiency out every SG&A dollar we spend. We want to be totally rigorous about that. So that we can allocate more of those dollars to R&D, I think that 60%, 70% last quarter might be an all-time high for the company. I haven't gone all the way back, but in my recent memory that was an all-time high. We're going to keep at that, we're going to continue to try to get better, we do this every words part of the culture of the company to be focused on continuous improvement. I don't know how we can get it obviously, but we're going to keep working on it.\nCraig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst\nThanks guys.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Craig.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll hear now from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. And I joined a little late, so I apologize if this was asked. But DRAM was quite strong in the quarter. And I'm wondering what caused that and how sustainable is that trend?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWhen I look at it, it's primarily conversion spending. That's really what we've seen for the entire year is focused on node conversions, it will ebb and flow. The important thing when you think about DRAM is to understand when we look at similar to what we were describing NAND exiting the year below where we believe demand growth to be, you got a similar story in DRAM. As we look at the investments that are occurring in DRAM this year exiting the year supply growth is probably in the low teens. And we believe long-term demand growth is in high teens maybe approaching 20%. There is a ways to go, Vivek to continue to burn inventory out of the channel. I think that's going to take a little bit longer. But what I do know is at some point the inventory will be burned off and spending will grow more significantly. In quarter-by-quarter, it's just going to be dependent on what projects are under way at what customers.\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, kind of, looking at your cash flow generation. So fiscal '19 from what I noticed there was a lot of cash inflow from working capital that I'm looking at the model right. How should we think about the plus and minus from working capital this year? Thank you.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIf you look at the first half of this year, Vivek -- calendar year again. I never really think too much in terms of fiscal calendar year. I mean we're -- cash was just super strong, I think we had two consecutive quarters around $900 million in operational cash flow and you're right. A lot of that came from working capital. Now what you normally see with the business when it's growing, it will consume working capital, meaning it will take cash to build inventory and receivables and so forth. When it levels off or contracts, it will generate cash and that's really what went on in the first half of the year. I mean, we managed cash quite proactively, but the practical reality of business ebb and flow was that's what happens. The right way to think about the free cash flow of the business is it's a couple of points below where operational cash flow should be on a sustainable basis. But it will ebb and flow around wherever read in the business cycle.\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThank you.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. You're welcome. Thanks for the question.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo.\nJoe Lachky -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nYes, thanks for taking the question. You talked about improvements and inventory that you've seen across the NAND flash. I was wondering, if you could talk about 2018 [Phonetic] factory utilization rates and your installed base?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt's hard for us actually to put our finger on exactly what utilizations are. I mean we saw it pulled back a little bit in both NAND and DRAM this year. And I think that was pretty well-telegraphed from our customers. But better -- it's a better question to put to them, we don't always know exactly what their utilizations are running at.\nJoe Lachky -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nOkay, fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up to that. You talked about exiting this year at 30% supply growth, I mean, for NAND and maybe and potentially going lower than that next year on the first part of the year. I guess, the question is how do we think about the level of capacity expansion needed to hit kind of the -- I guess, expected demand growth for 2020?\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nTough question to answer Joe, to be honest. What's occurred this year and NAND largely has been conversions, maybe with a couple exceptions. But if you look at NAND, WFE through the year -- this year, but that's what was going on. And you saw declining rate of supply growth such that as we exit the year obviously, we said 30% and I think long-term NAND growth is in the high '30s, maybe 40%. To have 40% supply growth, we need to be adding a few wafers every single year, and so it didn't happen quite so much this year and you've seen supply growth decline. I don't know if that helps you, but that's how I think about it.\nJoe Lachky -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\nMitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. I really had two and most of them have been answered. But from a high level, I mean, do you guys talking about kind of a better market for memory in 2020. So when do you think we'll see capacity upgrades or is this all going to be technology upgrades?\nAnd then secondly, you guys gave a lot of color on NAND, but not so much in DRAM. So based on the commentary about server demand and kind of an increase in Q1. Does that mean you guys think that -- that's going to be kind of the bottom or do you think that exiting the year, we're going to start to see supply demand balance for DRAM?\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think that what we've said about DRAM maybe just was that we think through the first half of next year. Inventory remains elevated and so it's really not, I guess our view at this point is DRAM maybe more of a second half story for next year. Obviously we'll give far more color as we develop our full 2020 outlook. It's just that NAND is much more upon us right now. Simply because the issues are being worked through more quickly as a result of the supply constraints that have been in place this year. And maybe also the demand catalysts for NAND that are occurring right now.\nMitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGot it. And is a capacity upgrades at what time in 2020 is that like back half or do you think capacity upgrades will begin earlier than that?\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nMitch too soon for us to talk in any detail about 2020, hold off for one quarter we'll give you a little better visibility on it. It's still a little bit too far away for us to get into detail.\nMitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay, got it. Thank you.\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Mitch.\nOperator\nThank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

{"date":"Nov 6, 2019, 12:00 p.m. ET","exchange":"NASDAQ: BBSI","q":"2019-Q3","ticker":"BBSI","transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nGood day, everyone and thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss BBSI's Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2019.\nJoining us today are BBSIs President and CEO, Mr. Michael Elich and the Company's CFO, Mr. Gary Kramer. Following their remarks, we'll open the call up for questions.\nBefore we go further, please take note of the Company's safe harbor statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company provides important cautions regarding forward looking statements. The Company's remarks during today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. These statements, along with other information presented that does not reflect historical fact are subject to matter of risks and uncertainties.\nActual results may differ materially from those implied by those forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company's recent earnings release and to the Company's quarterly and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information about the risks and uncertainties that could cause results, excuse me, that could cause actual results to differ.\nI'd like to remind everyone that this call will be available for replay through December 6, 2019 starting at 3:00 PM Eastern Time this afternoon. A webcast replay will also be available via the link provided in today's press release as well as available on the company's website at www.mybbsi.com.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of BBSI, Mr. Gary Kramer. Sir, please go ahead.\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Michelle. Depending upon where you're dialing in from, good morning or good afternoon, everyone. We had a very strong quarter that resulted in record earnings. Diluted income per share for the quarter increased 30% to $3.24 compared to $2.50 in Q3 of '18.\nGross billings of $1.55 billion grew 7% over the same period. PEO gross billings increased 8% to $1.52 billion compared to the third quarter last year. The third quarter of 2019 had one more work day when compared to the third quarter of 2018. When adjusting for the one-day difference, our gross billings increased approximately 6% over the prior year period.\nGross billings grew by 5% in California, versus 15% in all other combined geographies. Same customer sales were 5.7% compared to 4.7% in Q3 of '18. However, adjusting for the one-day difference, same customer sales would have been approximately 4.3% which was lower than Q3 of '18 and lower than our internal plan.\nWe continue to increase our client base with the gross addition of 386 clients or 217 net of runoff in the quarter. The 386 gross additions are a record number in any third quarter in our history.\nNet revenue of $248 million reflects a slight increase compared to $247.3 million in Q3 of '18 and reflected weaker staffing revenue, which decreased 17% to $33.8 million compared to Q3 of '18.\nThe decrease in staffing revenue is a direct result of the continued tight labor market, and we anticipate that staffing will remain a slight headwind to near-term revenue growth. Gross profit outpaced gross billings growth and increased 19% to $70.8 million compared to $59.7 million at Q3 of '18.\nGross payroll taxes and benefits as a percentage of payroll was 6.8% in Q3 of '19 versus 6.9% in Q3 of '18. Workers' compensation expense as a percentage of gross billings was 3.6% this quarter, which is below our expected range of 4.4% to 4.6%. This compares to 4.5% of gross billings in the third quarter of 2018.\nThe third quarter is when we reset our triangles and bring in another year of experience. The independent actuarial valuation resulted in a reduction of prior year estimated liability of $5.6 million. Also as previously discussed, we restructured our arrangement with Chubb to reduce frictional costs and this is the first pure quarter where all policies are effective on the more efficient structure.\nOur workers' compensation claims frequency continues to trend favorably. In the quarter, we saw trailing 12 month relative frequency of claims as a percentage of payroll decrease 12.9% compared to the third quarter of 2018. All in, we are very pleased with the way our workers' compensation portfolio is performing. We have taken many steps and actions which are yielding positive results. We are conservative and deliberate and this strict focus and attention has resulted in a redundancy in the portfolio, seven quarters in a row and why our expense continues to come in lower than our range.\nPayroll as a percentage of gross billings is increasing as other components of gross margin decrease. This is related to an increase in PEO business mix and continued expansion outside of California where many states have lower payroll tax and workers' compensation ratios.\nSG&A in the third quarter was $41.4 million which is 13% higher than the prior year quarter. This increase includes a timing portion for the extra business day plus a slight increase in profit sharing. We continue to be mindful and diligent about balancing spend against growth while investing in the business for the future.\nFor the full year of 2019, our SG&A is expected to be on plan.\nThe provision for income taxes in the third quarter was $6 million. As mentioned last quarter, we increased our annual effective tax rate estimate from 18% to 22%.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We mentioned last quarter that we successfully renewed our 7\/01\/19 insurance program with Chubb. This was a significant renewal, because we have moved closer together with our collective view of the actuarial loss rates. This was a tipping point for the balance sheet and results in accelerated growth of our unrestricted cash balance and our free cash flow.\nAccordingly, our unrestricted cash and investments were $137 million at 9\/30\/19 which is $36 million greater than 6\/30\/19 and a $100 million greater than 12\/31\/18. The restricted cash and investments, which are primarily comprised of the Chubb trust was $420 million at 9\/30\/19. The $557 million combined unrestricted and restricted cash and investments will continue to be invested in a manner consistent with our previous disclosures.\nWe continue to stay conservatively invested in shorter duration securities in the near term, we will [Phonetic] flattening yield curve. At 9\/30\/19, we had $173 million in cash that returned an annual crediting rate of 220 basis points. At September 30, the book yield for the invested portfolios was 238 basis points with a duration of 1.71 years. At 09\/30\/19, the average quality of the invested portfolios was AA and no investment was greater than 4% of the portfolio.\nIn the quarter, we earned $3.7 million of investment income. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we have no material updates. We had no borrowings on our credit line as of 9\/30\/19 and we continue to be debt free except for the $4 million mortgage on our corporate headquarters in Vancouver Washington.\nTurning to capital allocation. We have built a financial note around the Company and we will continue to be diligent and mindful regarding balancing investment in the Company while returning capital to shareholders. We have an authorized stock-repurchase plan, which is another tool to drive shareholder value but we did not buy back any stock in the quarter. We increased the dividend last quarter by 20% and have returned $6 million to shareholders so far this year.\nIn summary for the quarter, our branches are continuing to meet or exceed expectations regarding the control [Indecipherable] for gross and net client adds. We continue to experience margin expansion through product relevance while reducing costs in our model. Our gross billings continue to increase even with the softness of uncontrollable same customer sales. We continue to invest in the business and future growth and mindful of expenses and looking for savings and efficiencies in everything we do. Our pipeline remains strong and we continue to build our base of net new clients. Our referral relationships and distribution channels continue to widen. Our balance sheet has made the turn and we've built a financial note to support the Company but more importantly, our core earnings are strong and predictable.\nRegarding our outlook for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect gross billings growth for the next rolling 12-month period to be approximately 8%. This contemplates continuing deceleration in staffing revenue and same customer sales growth for PEO to be similar to what we have experienced thus far in 2019.\nFor the full year 2019, we are raising our estimate for diluted earnings per share by $0.65 to approximately $6.05. This increase reflects our core operating results, performing as planned, plus our workers' compensation portfolio performing better than expected, which is partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate to 23% from 18%.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect the range for workers' compensation expense as a percentage of gross billings to be 4.3% to 4.5%. This range can also be applied as an approximation when looking forward to 2020.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to the President and CEO of BBSI, Mike Ellich, who will comment further on the recently completed third quarter as well as our operational outlook for 2019. Mike?\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nHello and thank you for taking time to be on the call. As we do each year, we spent much of September in the field reviewing progress of 2019 and looking forward to 2020. From my view of the business, the organization looks strong and we continue to execute to our plan and support of our fundamentals.\nAdditionally, in September we introduced a new website and a new URL mybbsi.com. This is the first step moving forward, that will make us, excuse me, this is the first move in several we will make in the coming months to more accurately represent our value proposition to the market.\nAlso, we continue to spend time in the field with referral partners and business owners working to understand what they may be seeing in the market. These efforts and our visibility to the business continue to support confidence in our value proposition we -- as we look at the market.\nLooking forward in the quarter, we added 386 new PEO clients. We experienced attrition of 169 clients, 15 due to accounts receivable, 13 for a lack of tier progression, three due to risk profile, 20 businesses sold, 45 businesses closed and 73 left due to pricing competition and companies that have moved away from the outsource model. This represents an approximate build in the quarter of 217 net new client.\nAlso in the quarter, we took time to pull 10% of our existing clients to better understand what they may be seeing and speaking with these clients a majority are profitable and continue to see relevance in their offering, despite runway and opportunity, lack of skilled labor continues to be the limitation to growth and there continues to be some uncertainty related to a variety of macro issues. In general, the business owners we spoke to expressed optimism, but are not able to find the talent they need to grow, which is why we believe we are seeing softness in same customer sales.\nRelated to pipeline, we continue to see strong client adds in the quarter and we believe this is a result of our referral partners understanding and recommending BBSI. We continue to evolve our ability to scale from a model based on individual market contributors to a systemic approach for developing referral channels on a national basis. Today, we are seeing development of new referral channels in all markets which support strong pipeline growth as evidenced by continued new client adds.\nRelated to organizational structure, we continue to build the field organization to support future growth, scale into new markets and invest in support of our product offering. In the quarter, we added one business team bringing us to 114 business teams across 63 branch locations. We continue to build organizational structure at all levels, to that end, in October, we announced the addition of Diane Dewbrey to our Board of Directors, bringing our total count to eight members.\nRelated to branch stratification, we have 18 mature branches with run rates in excess of $100 million. This is a measure we use to indicate branches ability to increase leverage. We have 20 emerging branches running between $30 million and $100 million. We regularly reinvest back into these teams to support capacity as they grow.\nFinally, we have 25 branches we consider developing with run rates of up to $30 million. In these branches, we invest to support consistency of pipeline while maintaining integrity of product as they scale. As we add infrastructure to support capacity as dictated by our pipelines, we pay particular attention to our ability to add business teams in support of our growth. Looking forward, the fundamentals of the business are strong. We remain focused on bringing predictability and value to the business over the long run. Feedback I have received from our clients and referral partners supports relevance of our product as we look at the next five years.\nHaving spent a great deal of time in the field this year, my confidence in our ability to execute comes from the strength of our teams and the structure that allows us to stay nimble. We continue to invest in infrastructure that supports both product evolution and our ability to scale into new markets with predictable outcomes. Today, we have a foundation that is strong, we know where we need to focus our energy and we are executing to our plan.\nWith that, I'll turn it over for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nHey, good morning to you guys.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Chris.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nYeah, good morning. Maybe just focus a little bit on growth specifically outside California and kind of the impact that, that has kind of near and mid-term. Just start with maybe on the referral channels, so the referral channels that you have in California are well established. Can you talk a little bit about kind of how they look outside of California?\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nHey Chris, it's Kramer. So that's a good question and what we've really focused on is consistency in our product and consistency in how we deliver the product and how we go to market. So if you think about how we try to forge these relationships on a national basis, we've got a strategy for how we work with our referral partners in every state.\nSo if you're referral partner in Utah, you get treated to the same sort of service and platform as California. So it's going to vary by market, some of our markets that are more mature, like in the Mountain States versus, say, our East Coast branches that are opening up, that are going to take a little time to get those channels developed but the basic idea is, if you go in any BBSI store front, it looks the same, no matter what state you're in, and that referral partner gets treated with the same respect and service everywhere.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Chris, I might add to that, one of the things that I saw probably in the reviews that we did in the third quarter, just being out in the field was, one, our bench of leadership in all markets is very consistent. And you really don't see very much a difference between, call it, California and the Mountain States of the East Coast. The other thing I would say is that as we may have had -- if we grew up on the West Coast and California with more of an insurance offering in the past, as we've evolved that brand and have shifted it, that's taken more effort and we've had to reeducate and retool a lot of our referral partners in California. As we look at other states where we probably came at, a lot of our growth through a different value proposition, we're seeing an adoption of our current value proposition in those markets and probably an acceleration through our existing pipelines in those markets where we actually see a higher effective yield coming out of the referral channels that we get in markets outside of California.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nIt's interesting, I mean from a kind of customer or client size, It's -- the clients are smaller that you're -- on average that you're signing outside of California. You had kind of historically talked about a five-year timeframe for a successful branch to reach that $100 million level. Does the, kind of, starting on the smaller side, does that impact much that -- that potential progression that you see?\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, there is a little bit more of a headwind. And what you -- there is two sides to the smaller customer. The smaller customer is a lot of times when you see a new branch coming online, there is maybe a tendency to be more comfortable adding the smaller company and as you get more traction, you'll see that average client employee size increase in all markets.\nSo that's kind of the standard, but then you have to take into consideration that if you look at companies in Southern California versus companies in Utah or Boise, Idaho, there tends to be just by nature of population size and market demographics, they just tend to be smaller.\nSo it will take a little bit longer for us to get there, but one of the things I would say to is, today in our overall model, we get there faster today because I think we're more efficient in how we're adding and building pipeline and how we're adding business, than we maybe have been go -- if you went back 10 years ago.\nChris Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. That's helpful. I appreciate it. I'll jump back in line. Thanks guys.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Martin with Roth Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Martin -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst\nThanks, good morning, Mike and Kramer. How are you?\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Jeff.\nJeff Martin -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst\nI was wondering if you could comment on the implied Q4 guide relative to your updated guidance of $6.05 for the year. What implied down year-over-year, I know there are some things going on with payroll taxes, but I think it'd be helpful to kind of get some insight from you in an open format here on that.\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So if you think back for Q4 of '18, we have, call it, two non-recurring, so we had a change in estimate for workers' comp which was like $2.3 million. So when we're giving any forecast for the forward look, we don't forecast for any change in estimate. So that's one of the puts and then the other one was in Q4 of '18, we were estimating that we were going to have a payroll tax that was going to be due that ended up not being due. So, we took down that accrual in Q4 of '18.\nSo you've got, call it, two credits from '18 that don't repeat in '19. So if you normalize for those, we still are getting to earnings growth for Q4 of '19.\nJeff Martin -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst\nOkay. And then I was wondering if you could give us an update on the progress on some of the new branches and new business units that have opened up this year.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo as we've added new branches in new markets, we're finding that there is two style of branches. We'll say that if we add a branch in a market adjacency, we'll call that a tuck-in, typically those branches are started with talent that's already been working in a branch, be it a current business partner that may be moves to a new branch and opens that, for example, with that you're taking experience in 10 year and you're combining that with a book of business that gets started, that might be peeled off from local branches that it makes more sense for those customers to be in the new branches.\nWhen that happens, that branch one gets off the ground faster because of the talent, but also the momentum that's already there with the existing client and typically there is already a somewhat of a pull where you've got existing referral channels already built around that market.\nSo in those branches, we will find that they move pretty fast through that $20 million to $30 million to $50 million. They all have to go through a retool and a rebuild right around $60 million and we tend to get there more proactively today than we ever used to. But when I look at new branches that have ramped in the last couple of years, they're all doing very well, we don't have any branches that are stuck or needing to be retooled at this point relative to anything that's new. When we look at markets that we enter as a greenfield, we tend to take a little bit more time on the front end by having either that new manager or whoever is going to be running it sit in the wings for up to six months and really learn the business before they go out and enter those markets.\nWhat's helping us a lot also is that our referral channels are broader and once we go into a greenfield market, we find that we're able to create pipeline a lot quicker, so the pace of a greenfield might be a little bit slower than the tuck-in, but we're also seeing where those branches are ramping faster than historically.\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd I would just throw some numbers on it. When we set out our plan for the beginning of the year, we had, call it, four to five new branches. So far this year we've opened three branches, two in California and one in Colorado and we're in the process of signing the lease to open a location for another one in the Allentown area.\nSo we're, call it, hitting our number for the branches, and then when we think about the business units, business units were a little behind for our plan for where we thought we'd be. I think for the year, we're going to be slightly below it, and that's really just a function of timing more than anything else, more than change of strategy, it's just the timing on when you have to find the people, get them in and get them operationalized.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. We're looking at where we optimize the efficiency of capacity utilization against where we need to be to make sure we don't stall pipeline or anything. And our cap view has come up. If it was running closer to 58%, 59%, call it, at the beginning of the year, today, we're clustered about 64%, but we feel like we still have good runway to build capacity as necessary to business units, but we are kind of seeing where we are gaining more efficiencies through our teams and we're getting more done as well, so.\nJeff Martin -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst\nOkay. And then with the additional build on the balance sheet in terms of unrestricted cash. How are you looking at investments for growth versus share repurchases at this point?\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I mean first and foremost, when we think about having excess capital, right. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to invest in our businesses and invest in our branches in our business units. And then we're going to look and we're going to invest in things that make the Company either revenue synergies or expense synergies, ie, IT, information technology. And then you know, we're not a very acquisitive company, when you think of our value prop. People are our product then why buy it when you can grow it. So then we get down to the next tranche which is raising the dividend, which we've done and then stock purchase -- stock repurchase, which the Board authorized last quarter for $50 million over three years. That's a tool that we will utilize if we see any kind of dislocation in the market to be a backstop for when we think the stock is undervalued and I can just say that we don't have an itchy trigger finger and we're going to be smart and methodical with how we spend our shareholders dollars.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I would say too and to complement that, Jeff, that when we look at investments that we've made, typically when we add a branch, it's not capitalized. So it just comes up through our own earnings stream and it becomes the headwinds to earnings. One of the areas that we have been putting a lot of energy back into is just bringing a new look and maturity level to our overall IT platform and once we get into 2020 and beyond, we'll be rolling that but with probably a broader strategy today than we've had in the past, relative to how we're building technology and where we're going with that as a complement to our existing infrastructure and model, so.\nJeff Martin -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst\nRight. All right. Okay, last question. Some of your peers have had issues with underwriting healthcare insurance. Just want to clarify that you have no exposure to underwriting healthcare and some of the similar issues that others are having.\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So we do not offer healthcare to our clients, as you're seeing with some of our peers that they can be difficult risk to underwrite and we don't really feel the need for it in our value prop. When we think about the risk we do take, call that, workers' comp and for that risk, we have a very methodical process for how we bring clients on, for how we work with the clients to align better for how we can work with them to mitigate risk and we feel like, really we can make that a better underwriting decision as opposed to the healthcare side, which is more of a challenging risk that it's more difficult to mitigate.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I would also say that, Jeff, as we've grown and matured our model over time, that the healthcare side is although an opportunity, I think it always has been a little bit of conflict with what we're really trying to get done with our business owners and we're running our high-touch model, I would rather be non-captive to health benefits and have professionals that can come in and really support our clients for where they're living rather than have one stop fits all and -- and as we have stayed outside of that and stayed risk-neutral on the healthcare level, we still have mechanisms, where we can help our clients find the best resources, but we do that as a service rather than taking underwriting risk.\nJeff Martin -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you guys.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Vogel with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nThank you. Hi, Mike and Kramer.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Josh.\nJosh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nMike, you usually give us some commentary around the average pay and over time trends across your client base. I was wondering if you could share that with us.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo, in the quarter, I'll probably defer to the absolutes with Kramer. One of the things that we have seen probably is it relates to growth in same customer sales are still probably coming from wage inflation and, but I'll let Kramer talk to this more of the detail with that.\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Hey, Josh, it's more of the same trends that we talked about last quarter. So when I give you numbers here, I'm going to adjust it for the one extra day. So we're still seeing, of our 4.3% increase in same customer sales, the lion's share of that is wage inflation, which is going to be in the mid-to-high 2's. And then after wage inflation, you get a little bit of a bump up in headcount adds. And then you get after that, you get a little bit of a bump up in hours worked so when we're looking at how this -- how our same customer sales is performing, it's probably going to be in this -- over this next cycle, I'll say, next 18 months, it's going to primarily come from the wage inflation. I don't -- with unemployment at a sub-35, I just don't see how we're going to get the uptick in WSCs.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. And I would say, Josh and meeting and spending time with our clients, they are -- a lot of them just turned a good spot. They're doing well. They're profitable, they're making money and what we did notice probably over the last couple of quarters is that wage or hours worked did somewhat normalize were to me that's where business owners aren't finding that they have to stress their organization to capture market opportunity, but more have modulated themselves to make sure that their capacity is aligned with the opportunity and not to push it to have a lot of over time, and in doing so, I think, are running more profitable businesses.\nThe one flip, and this is maybe off this mark a little bit that we noticed in the conversation that we we're having a couple of weeks with a group of owners, is that you're seeing a little bit of a transition where you have an old guard and a young guard. The older guard is the group that is on the businesses for a long time lived through '08, '09, '10 and as they look at their business, they can think about growth, they can think about where they're going. But they are not going to break it to take unnecessary risks.\nThe interesting part is the younger guard is coming in where you've got maybe a mid-30's group that seems to almost be a split now in the room where they're actually buying companies, they're doing acquisitions, they're more aggressive and they are building for their future. And so there is a little bit of a shift going on there, it's more anecdotal at this point, but I think that there is a little bit of that going on as well.\nJosh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And I don't want to get too into the weeds here, but you did mention that 45 businesses closed in your attrition number for PEO clients and I was just curious, is that mostly being seen in California or elsewhere and then I can't find it in my notes, but i'm just, it seems a little high. I was wondering how that stat has trended this year and how often you evaluate your client base and given how immersed you are in their business as a partner, do you typically see the writing on the wall before they do?\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo, we've got very good visibility as we work with that client. The idea of closing versus selling is probably a closing could mean that they changed in FDIA[Phonetic] number and move to different ownership structure and we probably wouldn't be able to see or dissect that as much as we recognize that the business was there and then it wasn't there,\nThe businesses that sold, we recognize that they moved -- they shifted ownership structure there and typically we might capture that same business on the other side, but the trend has upticked in the last couple of quarters between businesses sold and businesses closed. But one thing I'd kind of look at that a little bit too, though, is this, on a relative basis if you said I have 65 clients in the quarter that either closed or sold, it's less than 1% of our total base of business. So as our overall base grows, those numbers may get skewed a little bit when you look at them, just on a -- from a real standpoint.\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And I would say, Josh, we pay attention to companies that have the potential to go dark from a credit perspective and we've got a push, we push $6 billion through the pipe. And if you look at our allowance and our expense for companies that go dark, it's not even a rounding issue because we got pretty, pretty tight on how we do that side of it. So we're usually ahead of it than behind it if they are going dark.\nJosh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks for the thoughts around that. And just around that, let's say, you rolled out, I was curious how that's being received across the client base. And can you discuss some of the other efforts that are planned for rollout and if this involves any notable investment or outlays on your end?\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo,\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nI'm reluctant to call it anything related to a rebrand and that when you start to shop different in the market, that's how it can be perceived. What I would say is that as we discussed internally, we started to really rebuild and restructure and realign who we are from the inside out before we ever decide we could look different from the outside looking in.\nAnd so when we pull the organization as a whole and we ask them when do they really think that we started to rebound or retool ourselves, people will point back to 2011, 2012. We finally have reached a place where all the pieces that we've been pulling together for the last many, many years have reached a place where we can actually tell a different story.\nAnd that story has been well received. I think that if you go out to the new website, It's under mybbsi.com, you'll see maybe a story that represents a lot of what we've been talking about the last couple of years, but it aligns us with what we really believe were brand to market and as business owners and different people see it they -- with the one comment that I've had back for me is that it finally talks about what we really do. And that's where we're excited about that.\nAs we look forward, I think that as we look at what's possible from here, we've got a very strong core business. I think we've got good core discipline around how we interface with our clients through our blueprinting, through how we basically manage and manage the full client life cycle through our framework process that we have and then ultimately how we tie that out with the talent that we have in front of clients every day, and then how we support that with technology.\nSo those are all things that will continue to enhance as it relates to different places that you might see us show up. It will be -- you might find us in different venues, showing up in our -- in different ways. But I think the real emphasis toward where the direction we're going is, when you think about mybbsi versus BBSI, it implies community and when we look at business owners that we pulled together, we are building communities both locally and super regionally around an idea that they don't have to be alone and that they actually have a place to go and a partner that they can be there with to help them increase their own probability for success.\nSo that's the direction we're going with it and but through these communities that we're building, and we've been, -- we've been working on this for about three years now, when we bring a group of business owners and we start to get them to talk to each other, it's game changing. And as we get better in the field working with our clients, it's actually accelerating. So I'm excited about all those things and we'll keep you posted as there is more to look at.\nJosh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst\nSounds good. Thanks for taking my questions guys.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Dezellem with Tieton Capital Management. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nThank you. I have a group of questions. And I'd like to start just picking up on where you left off. Early in the opening remarks, you said that mybbsi was just a first of many steps that you will be making to highlight your value proposition. Would you please kind of open the shades on the window and give us a look into what you're going to be doing from this point forward to highlight that value proposition?\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I'm going to make them blind and as we kind of turn the little thing in the blinds up a little bit, let a little bit of sunlight in, I'll give you that much. How about that?\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nThat's great.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nAs we look at -- again, if there is a theme about what we've been building over many years, it's been about creating a client interface where our clients see us as a true partner, and through the interface that we have with them over a long period of time, they see us as their true advocates.\nAs we look also to our referral channels and we educate and help them understand the value they can bring to their clients by introducing us into the DNA of their client base, that begins to support it. So if you look at the theme around mybbsi being a community, there are a lot of things we can do there related to our access point where we can bring them in, and give them exclusive access to the collective of business owners that we work with.\nSo I think that when we look at technology aligned with that, that becomes one way that we are broadening that network and access to information that's proprietary to us. When I look at just where we start to show up outside of what we do already, we do a lot of our, I'll call it, referral channel developing through a networking strategy and through a channel strategy and we build it through an event strategy and as we have events where we bring a lot of our referral partners in to really understand and have an experience with BBSI as well as our channel partners that we work with that support us as well as we bring customers in that becomes a little bit of an incubator to learn a little bit more.\nWe have today three LPGA events that we use where we'll bring and do create environments that literally it's -- there is barrier to entry. They can't get into those but over periods of times, we've brought groups through and we've got very, very firm relationships over time. With that we've looked at the idea of front running new markets that we might be getting too and creating a way -- efficient way and cost effective way to being able to start building a -- building visibility in the market to a broader footprint over time and using the LPGA a little bit, but we've actually, this last year we're on three or two new golf bags that are on tour year round out on the LPGA.\nWhat we recognize there is 77% of those individuals that participate in a Pro-Am and participate as business owners in Pro-Ams are CEOs or business owners. So we're tapping a market that allows us to, one, create an experience, we're also getting our brand out in front of us without being -- go on TV and media wise. But we're creating environments to build relationships with our referral channels and then ultimately to begin to expand and create avenues where the brand of BBSI and mybbsi are being seen by those people that might be our audience either today or in the future and creating more of a curiosity approach.\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nThank you. And you had also mentioned that your referral relationships were widening. Would you talk about that and really what you mean when you state that?\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nWhen I look at somebody that is a potentially a person that's aligned and a trusted advisor to a business owner, when we first meet them, we would probably tier them as a Tier 1 referral partner and that individual probably can kind of get who we are, they see us as may be an opportunity for them to create business for themselves, but it tends to be a little more transactional. So as we recognize the work we have to do through education and through helping them see maybe the opportunity through a different lens, we spend a lot of time working with that -- those individuals both in local markets in micro regions throughout our network of branches and then on a more global basis as we get to a point where we're doing business and they're starting to get to understand our value proposition, we'll bring them into environments to help them see their -- see the product through the eyes of their own business, if that makes sense.\nSo if you think of somebody that might own a -- an accounting firm or a law firm or an insurance agency, they're running a business and rather than help them see the product is that might be explained will bring them into a similar environment that we bring our business owners into and when we do that, they actually start to see the product from the inside out and start to really understand the nature of what we're trying to do.\nFrom there, we double back and we'll tend to work with their internal organization to help mature and help them understand it. That might lead us to a Tier -- a Level 2 or Tier 2 referral partner that at that time now all the sudden becomes one of those areas where we've got a still handhold a little bit, but they're catching on and they're getting there.\nIf we can now evolve that relationship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, you get the Tier 3 referral partner that probably understands they can articulate our value proposition, as well as we can. Now they're really doing work for us in the market.\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And as you so presumably have been, you are seeing an increasing number of the partners you would consider Tier 3 and hence the widening of the relationships.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. And so one of the areas, the one of the ways we look at that is through yield, and as we look at opportunities that we have presented to us versus the number of conversions or the yield on the original opportunities, that's a little bit of where we then start to stratify where is that business coming from, from who and then what's our effective yield with different audiences.\nThe one thing that we have also seen in this last quarter and probably a couple of quarters is a significant uptick in referrals from existing clients.\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nMike, I think you mentioned in your opening remarks or somewhere in this call that the California yield was less than referral channel yield was less than outside of California. So congrats on having more referrals from existing customers. But what can or needs to be done to improve that referral channel yield in California?\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I would probably -- what I meant was the way the channel works is if you look at first meeting to second meeting to third meeting to fourth meeting, there's -- the fall off happens differently. When we finally get to the ultimate yield of the ultimate --- of the first pipeline that we see to the end, it's pretty much in line with what we see and in California as well and it's pretty consistent across all states, but how it happens is different.\nSo I thank you for bringing that up so I can clarify that. The other part, though, that I would say is that, as we have seen the uptick of even with client referral, it's the more we execute and the more clarity we bring to the market as to what we really do, it's more of a time-based maturing process that is allowing us to get more from the opportunities that we have.\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I would just put some numbers around that. Our efficiency ratio is, right, for how we acquire clients is pretty consistent, whether it's California or all other geographies. We are growing quicker outside of California, but California is still adding more clients than outside of California and it's just -- and we get to California, it continues to grow and it's -- so we would like diluting the ocean because we've got such a big footprint in California.\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nThank you. And then I do want to talk about claims frequency and then I'll -- then I'll be done here. You said claims frequency dropped to roughly 13%. What was behind that success?\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nYou know, I wish we could pinpoint to the one thing and do it over repetitively, but when you're doing these things, it's a lot of a little things. So we've got about 30 different strategies, and those 30 different strategies are yielding the favorable results that we're seeing. So it's not one thing we can pinpoint to, it's a lot of little things, but we feel very comfortable with where we are for the year for workers' comp, for claims coming in, for the value of the claims. We feel very comfortable about what we're seeing on the prior years, and you can see those results in the consistent redundancies that we have in the prior year loss picks.\nSo, the only thing I can say is we have a disciplined strategy and we are conservative and we are executing to that strategy. And then you start to see the conservatism unwind over time.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I would add that it's more of a systemic approach to all the things that we do from when we bring a new client on board to actually the level of retention that we have with the overall base and that the longer we do business with a client, the more apt they are to be better run companies and I think that's probably where we see one area that makes a big difference.\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nSo were you serious, when you said 30 different things to improve the claims frequency?\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nWe have many tools in the box.\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nSo is this just one of those examples where the business is being run much better from an operational perspective than it was several years ago and as part of this consistency that you referenced in your opening remarks, as part of what is going to lead to that consistency going forward?\nGary Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer\nI would say this that BBSI is better and I would say that the value that we're bringing to our client is better. So when you take the two, it becomes a multiplicative effect.\nBill Dezellem -- Tieton Capital Management -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you both for taking so many questions.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Elich for any closing remarks.\nMichael L. Elich -- President, Chief Executive Officer\nAgain, thank you for continuing on this journey with us.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brad Cray, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrad Cray -- Investor Relations\nThank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined by Yuval Dagim, Caesarstone's Chief Executive Officer; and Ophir Yakovian, Caesarstone's Chief Financial Officer. Certain statements in today's conference call and responses to various questions may constitute forward-looking statements. We caution you that such statements reflect only the company's current expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors contained in the company's most recent annual report on form 20-F and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn addition, on this call, the company will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the company's Second Quarter 2019 earnings release, which is posted on the company's Investor Relations website.\nThank you. And I would like to now turn the call over to Yuval. Please go ahead.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Brad and good morning, everyone. In the first half of 2019, we have completed a build out of our core leadership team and began executing our global growth acceleration plan. The plan is designed to improve operation efficiencies and reignite growth through a variety of projects across our business and functions while better allocating our resources. As part of this plan and as previously announced in May, we completed a global headcount reduction of approximately 7% across all our business units to improve our efficiencies and cost structure in a range of areas.\nIn conjunction with these actions, we reduced effective capacity in our US manufacturing facility by 50%. We work to improve our performance and refine our production strategy to increase efficiency and optimize our inventory as already reflected in our results. We are managing a global growth acceleration plan under 10 work streams, covering all aspects of our business, from innovation, production and supply chain to our brand and go-to market. I'm excited with the unified determination of our team to drive improvement in our business through these projects.\nAs part of realignment of our North American operation earlier this year, our progress is evident from encouraging results in our core business in the US which grew 12% year-over-year. We are in the process of significantly expanding our US. sales force to further improve our presence in large underrepresented metropolitan areas. We expect to keep expanding the US sales force through 2020 as we see great potential in these markets and expect a high return on our investment. Regarding tariffs, our global markets are adjusting to the new conditions following the final resolution on imported quartz countertops from China to the US. These newly imposed duties have adversely impacted our markets outside the US, mainly in Australia and Canada, that have seen a more competition coming from China.\nThe impact was greater than it's anticipated and resulted in a softer than expected performance during the second quarter, while the expected benefits of our initiatives give us confident in achieving our full-year EBITDA outlook for 2019, we adjusted our expectations from revenue to reflect a more competitive environment than originally anticipated.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with the overall progress that we saw in our initiatives during the second quarter. As we continue to improve our scalability for new growth opportunities. I look forward to updating you further on our progress next quarter.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Ophir who will provide details on our results and outlook.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Yuval and good morning, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results. For the second quarter 2019, global revenue was $141.1 million compared to $139.2 million in the second quarter of last year, approximately half of the decline was attributable to an adverse affects impact of $3.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined by 2.9% compared to last year due to soft market conditions combined with more competitive markets, mainly in Australia and Canada along with lower performance in Ikea US. This was partially offset by improved performance in our core US business and continued strong momentum in the U.K.\nIn the United States, second quarter sales increased by 7% compared to the second quarter of 2018. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in our core US business which grew 12% year-over-year and was mainly linked to actions taken by the new North American leadership team. As Yuval mentioned, the net impact of tariffs imposed on Chinese quartz countertop imports to the US has been unfavorable to our global footprint. The final determination on tariffs was in June and was generally consistent with the preliminary duties imposed on -- in the second half of 2018.\nAs a result of the tariffs, we have seen a surge in imports to the US from other developing countries in particular, India and Turkey. Outside the US, other developed markets continue to be served by Chinese manufacturers at low price points as the global market is still adjusting to this new condition. We can say that we have experienced an adverse impact outside of the US which was more severe than I initially anticipated, particularly in Australia and Canada. To that point, in Australia, constant currency sales were down 12%. The decline was attributable to continued competition, mainly from Chinese manufacturers as I just mentioned. This was coupled with very soft housing and remodelling markets which remain effected by more rigid lending standards and increased mortgage rates.\nIn Canada, constant currency sales were down 11.6%, our performance was affected by softness in housing and remodeling markets, we have declining trends and housing completion, combined with more intense competition from Chinese imports. Sales in Israel, on a constant currency basis, were down 3.5% as we experienced lower volume, mainly due to challenging housing market conditions.\nIn Europe, constant currency sales grew 15.7% mainly reflecting continued strong momentum in the U.K. Revenue in the rest of the world was also impacted by the Chinese competition, discussed earlier and on a constant currency basis, it was down 27%.\nLooking at our second quarter P&L performance, adjusted gross margin was 27.3% compared to 32.4% in the prior year quarter and 25.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The lower year-over-year adjusted gross margin mainly reflects the increased manufacturing unit costs due to lower fixed cost absorption driven by lower capacity utilization and FX headwinds partially offset by lower raw material costs.\nAs we mentioned on our last earnings call, the second quarter of 2018 was our highest gross margin quarter in 2018, which we did not expect to repeat this quarter, primarily due to lower capacity utilization. Operating expenses for the second quarter benefited primarily from lower marketing and sales expenses compared to the prior year quarter in line with our more prudent spending policy. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $19.2 million, a margin of 13.6% compared to $24.6 million, a margin of 16.5% in the prior year quarter. This primarily reflects the lower gross margin compared to last year, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in this -- in the quarter were $0.23 compared to $0.43 in the same period last year on a similar share count. We ended the second quarter of 2019 with strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits of $99.4 million with no financial debt.\nMoving to our outlook, for the full year 2019, we reiterate our adjusted EBITDA outlook to be in the range of $72 million to $80 million while moderating our anticipated revenue to a range of $550 million to $565 million. As discussed today, our outlook factors in our expectation for soft global market conditions and the competitive environment to persist in many of our region outside the US during 2019. Specifically, we now expect that the softer-than-expected performance in Australia and Canada as well as in some of our indirect markets will continue for the remainder of the year.\nAs a reminder, the financial impact of our global growth acceleration plan is included in our outlook for 2019 and is intended to drive additional growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the coming years. In the US, we continue to expect stronger revenue growth in the second half of 2019, as the enhancements that we are making in our North America region will start yielding better results. Based on the cost reduction actions, as well as other initiatives to enhance our production and supply chain operations. Our full year gross margin should be roughly stable year-over-year despite lower expected revenue base. To formulate our outlook, we have used current FX rates and raw material prices change -- changes to FX, all raw material costs may impact our outlook as we move through the year.\nLooking beyond 2019. In May, we introduced our long-term margin goals. We have a range of initiatives in the works under the multi-year global growth acceleration plan. We have a clear path to improve our performance. These plans support our long term gross margin target of 32% to 35% and our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 17% to 18%. The primary drivers for margin improvement are expected to come from: sales growth, particularly in the US, where we expect to benefit from better ASP and product mix; higher capacity utilization of our production facilities; improved efficiencies from our global growth acceleration plan; and finally, introducing innovative products to accelerate growth and improve profitability.\nWe are encouraged that the actions we took in the second quarter have already yielded improvement in our margin and operating leverage. Our team's commitment, along with continued execution of our strategy through the global growth acceleration plan, gave us confidence, as we look forward.\nThank you and we are now ready to open the call for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, everyone or good afternoon in Israel. First question, if I could just try and get a sense when you are able -- reiterating the 2019 EBITDA outlook despite the lowering of sales, which is just obviously pretty encouraging. I was -- would love to get a sense of since a quarter ago, you've had different changes occur in your outlook, obviously you've cited some pluses and some minuses, some -- some tailwinds and some headwinds. When you think about the reiteration of the EBITDA guidance. I'd love to get a sense of obviously, everything kind of offset each other, but -- relative to a quarter ago, if you can kind of give us a -- any type of quantification of what the EBIT, the incremental negative impact on EBITDA was from, some of the headwinds that you've discussed, like the softer sales backdrop, the more competitive backdrop that you're seeing as a result of that in Australia and Canada, maybe even in the US. And then offsetting that, maybe what some of the positives are that you're seeing that allowed you to maintain that full year EBITDA guidance.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Michael, it's Yuval. Yeah, thanks for the question. I think, putting the growth acceleration plan in front of us, as the new platform. It's actually allowed us to put quite many projects together in order to speed up the improvement and efficiencies in our company. And I think what we got from the first quarter, the second one is a nice tailwind, if you like, to allow us to, to absorb this reduction in revenue. So all in all, I think we're growing the US and we have more and more challenging times in Australia and Canada. But the actions we took in the first quarter, across-the-board, in all over the -- in the company, in all functions and regions, kind of allowing us to -- to kind of bit more confident with EBITDA performance for year.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And just to complete, we reduced the headcount by 7% as we announced, the part of it was temporarily reducing the capacity in our Richmond Hill facility in the US to 50%. So all this -- and then in addition to that, cut other operating expenses that gives us the confidence that we can achieve the EBITDA target for the year. I would like to add to that, that we are expecting to increase partially the capacity utilization in our factories in the second half of the year. So this is also something that will help us, improve our margins.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nSo maybe asked another way, obviously a quarter ago, you were still -- the global growth acceleration plan, the headcount reduction, the reduction in capacity, all of those things were expected -- a part of the plan three months ago. However, three months ago, you weren't expecting as much of a softer sales backdrop and some of the additional headwinds -- tougher sales environment in Australia, Canada, the more competitive environment, those things you were not expecting and that, that hurt your performance or reduced your sales growth outlook. What I'm trying to get a sense of it, let's say you didn't have those incremental headwinds, would we be looking at a -- an increase in EBITDA guidance by a certain amount because obviously you are still expecting all those benefits and they just got offset by these incremental headwinds. So I'm just trying to get a quantification of what that difference was?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, so, first -- there are different dynamics here from FX rates to prices of raw materials, that also changed and provided some headwind, a tailwind. So if you were look at that. I think that we also identified some things that were less clear to us that we can achieve in this year and we will manage to have a clearer path on achieving them this year and we have more confidence that we can achieve more efficiencies in our operating expenses and hence, we think that, this is achievable.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd also, Mike, in terms of organizational behavior, if you like. You see all leaders kind of joining forces together, and I'm very excited with this behavior. So wherever we could find an upside to bring back to the P&L by executing that, that was exactly what we were kind of doing, and I think we've delivered on our expectation in that sense.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nAny quantification on the raw material benefit this year relative to your outlook three months ago?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I can say that -- if you look at it in the -- in this quarter, it was compared to last year it was 1%, approximately 1%. It will give us a few -- I think, it will be less less than 1% in the -- for the full year, but it was tailwind.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay. Secondly, maybe I could ask a question more broadly about your competitive position in the US. In the past, you've given out market share data that kind of puts you in the low double-digits, 10%,12% or so, maybe a little bit more in terms of your market share in the US. I think those share positions were kind of last published in the last couple of years, just trying to get a sense of, how you think about your updated, your current competitive position in the marketplace, I mean, over the last couple of years, the marketplace has changed dramatically, maybe you could kind of walk through by channel where you think your position from a share standpoint? Who are the other major competitors? And why you think you can -- I am -- I am assuming obviously over the last couple of years, the market has grown perhaps you've lost a little bit of share. How you're thinking about regaining that share.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt's good comment, Michael. I think, it's been a few quarters that, and maybe more, but we are saying to the market and to ourselves, that most of our current performance in the US are in our hands to improve and to work on, and I think that is what happening in the last quarter or two. We put a new team in place, we created the North American region. We took our best talent in the region and put them in the more senior positions. And I think we started to see the fruits or the improvements coming to -- to be in our side. All in all, it was -- in the past, it was our focus -- sorry, our guess of the market share in our view and I think it's -- it's too early to say whether say in a different position. Now, definitely what I can say is that we are more -- way more confident that we can capture the opportunity that that we've seen in the market in the US, and we're definitely going to see growth coming from the US business over the next quarters.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nAlright. One last one, if I could. I think you said that in the US, the imports -- the China -- the tariffs or duties on the China imports, -- Chinese imports in the US are fully in place, but did I hear right that you said that you're also now seeing maybe an increase in imports in India and Turkey and I just wanted to make sure, I heard that right, and if you could give us a sense if the amount of imports from those regions are equal to the prior amount of imports from China? Are they half of the amount of imports from China? Just trying to get a sense of how big that activity is, and to the extent that it's replacing any of the prior Chinese import activity?\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Mike. That's a very good point. We see a significant increase in the import from low cost manufacturers, specifically more in India -- from India, Turkey, but from others as well. In terms of the magnitude, if you look at the import data publishing -- import data from March, April, May, and compared it to the equivalent period. Last year, you see that there is a significant say, replacement of the Chinese import by, I wouldn't say why, but one by one, but it's pretty close to what was the to the level that was imported last year.\nSo I think that there is no vacuum here. I would say that, that the growth --- that's why we said that the growth that we see is more related to the actions that we are taking and the changes that they were made in the US organization under the new leadership there and as we said, we are planning to expand our footprint in the US because we think there is a really great opportunity for us in this -- in this market to grow in the coming years.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nAll right. Thank you.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Michael.\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line Dillard Watt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDillard Watt -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, gentlemen. I want a follow up and ask a follow up on the India and Turkey and other countries that you're seeing import into the US. Is that a -- are you seeing similar -- either landed prices or retail or however you want to measure the price point, is it still -- is it still a pricing headwind that you were -- you had experience in the past with the Chinese competition that was pretty disruptive to the business?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Dillard, it's it's Yuval. I think it's pretty much the same. We are -- from the data that we have, we are experiencing probably the similar price points coming from different locations. I guess, -- the change from China to India is actually in the same segment with the same prices. So obviously, average price, so it's -- it has -- these are accuracy measurement, but all in all I think normal I think, you'll see the same -- same behavior in the market. There's no shortfall of the low cost manufacturing slabs or sources in the US and again, I think it's -- it's mostly what we are doing internally in our business to capture the opportunity rather than less of competition.\nDillard Watt -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nOkay. And then I hate to belabor the point too much here on the various low cost competition, but if it's coming in now to Canada, Australia, does they have benefit -- a little bit of some mix of hindsight and experience from what has occurred in the US, -- what might be the strategy to offset some of the volume pressures in those other countries at the same time that you're having some macro pressures there.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think what we're experiencing is more competition in Australia and Canada, mostly in the commercial area with the high rise building and multi-units. This is where -- it's more price sensitive and we see more competition coming. It's only partial or part of our portfolio in those countries and I think we continue to build on our very strong Caesarstone brand in those countries we are very strong with, consumers and the K&B shops. And I think we'll continue to work on, on the demand throughout coming in this -- in this market.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd to add to that, it's really -- when you look at the Australian housing market, it's a very soft market conditions that combined with the competition, gets us to that result, but need to take that into consideration, that the market conditions are pretty soft.\nDillard Watt -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nYeah. Okay, and then lastly for me, if there's any update on any possible news with the home centers here in the US, that would great.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo, no formal news at the moment. We are still working on this relationship -- this relationship, I think it's going well so far, but not to the point that we can advise the market on a new deal or that -- or the full agreement on those relationship, but there was still keeping positive on this opportunity.\nDillard Watt -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nSo it's fair to say then that the acceleration in the core business came from more the K&B [Phonetic] type side of the business.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, for sure. I mean, in the US, we saw a decline in IKEA this quarter as well, but the core business grew 12% and it came from K&B, in our retail side of the business and from [Phonetic] the new building, but not from their big books.\nDillard Watt -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- Analyst\nOkay, great. That does for me. Thank you.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Dillard.\nOperator\nOur next question is a follow up from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nThanks. Could I get a sense of what your price mix was or average sales price this quarter versus last quarter versus a year ago?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nWhen you when you look at the ASP, you need to take into consideration that it's, the combination of mix -- regional mix, the product mix and of course, it's affected by the different foreign exchange rates between the quarter. The period, I can say that compared to last year, there was a small decline in the price, but I think it's not -- I mean, something that it's much more -- a much expected in this environment.\nGoing forward, the fact that we are going to grow in the US and this is where we see the growth coming. We expect to see better prices there, and then I think that overall mix is this -- in the US, it's better and we should expect the growth in the ASP once we grow more in the portion of the US is higher.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nI appreciate that. Particularly, given all the complexities with the different regions, maybe just focusing on the US, if you could give us a sense of what price what's your ASP, did last year, and what you expect it to do this year? What you hope it can do in 2020.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike, I just think -- we would like to take a look at the net numbers and we will come back to you, just a second.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay. Maybe one -- other one while you're looking at that. The IKEA business has obviously been a lot of volatility -- a source of a lot of volatility. In the last couple of years, I think both in the US and most notably, but also Canada to a -- to a secondary extent. I was just trying to get a sense of what percent of the -- roughly what percent of the business in the US and in number one and secondly in Canada, what, what does IKEA represent as a percent of the business? And, is this a partner that makes sense strategically given all the volatility?\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nJust before the numbers, Michael, I guess the fact that they're growing in their core business, I think gives a hint on where we are putting our focus and it's definitely -- everything that is in our hands and the relationship that we can build with consumers and customers is where we are putting our focus and resources. And yes, I think that the IKEA revenue keeps being volatile and we see that growth in this quarter as well. So, yeah, we are reporting on that, it's still part of our business, but definitely there our focus is on the retail side of the business.\nOphir Yakovian -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, as for the percentage, it's a -- it's less than 10% of our overall revenues as a company and provide us a good, our profitability and it's good business for us, but it's, less than 10% of our overall business.\nMichael Rehaut -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Yuval Dagim, CEO for closing remarks.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you for your attention this morning.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Allison Lubert, Vice President of Communications.

Welcome, everyone, to Green Dot's Q3 2020 Earnings Call. It's been a busy and productive few months since we last gathered. We are pleased to report a better-than-expected third quarter, which we attribute to a number of factors, including our continued work to drive efficiencies and lower cost and increased demand for our products across our consumer, retail and B2B offerings. We remain focused on unlocking new opportunities and capitalizing on the accelerated shift from cash to digital banking and payments which was further eliminated by the pandemic and other dynamics taking place in the marketplace. As we end, we are already seeing benefits from our work-from-anywhere initiative from both a cost savings and talent recruitment perspective. In a few minutes, I'll pass it over to Jess to walk you through the details of our financial results, but I'd like to start by sharing a few highlights and my perspective on what contributed to a solid third quarter. I'm going to focus on three key areas of progress to stem back to the objectives I laid out earlier this year.\nThese will include improving our financial performance and execution, refocusing and enhancing our bass strategy and launching our new and lasting challenger bank initiative. While Jeff will cover the financial performance in detail, let me provide you with my take on the results for the quarter. Non-GAAP revenue increased 22% compared with the third quarter of the prior year. This higher revenue was driven by a combination of new and existing customers using Green Dot products to electronically receive your income, elevated deposit balances from stimulus funds received in Q2, growth in our BaaS partner fees and accelerated demand for digital banking and payments products. We also started to see recovery in areas of our business that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Our total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2020 increased by $42 million compared to the third quarter of the prior year, and our margins expanded by approximately 100 basis points. A big component of the increase in operating expenses was related to growth of our BaaS business.\nWe also had lower marketing expenses in the quarter. If you recall, Green Dot spent a majority of its full 2019 marketing budget in the second half of 2019. Finally, we had a few headwinds to margins, especially and increased revenue share with one of our key retail partners, higher transaction losses on our purchase volume and the timing-related expenses associated with incentive compensation for our employees. Moving on to our BaaS business. As we previously announced, we officially kicked off new relationships with Intuit and Kabbage in the third quarter, which further positions Green Dot to serve and Empower America's 30 million plus small businesses and entrepreneurs. Leveraging Green Dot's capabilities into it announced their plans to launch a QuickBooks cash account and Kabbage announced plans for Kabbage checking. We're also very excited about Kabbage's accelerated potential now that there are parts of American Express. Through these products, small business owners will now have access to more seamless, safe and value-driven banking and cash management for their businesses. We're incredibly proud to be a part of this movement, and look forward to deepening our partnerships with Intuit and Kabbage and doing more for small businesses in the future. We believe the opportunity for Green Dot to offer its services to the vast SMB segment is immense, and we look forward to providing you with more updates regarding this opportunity.\nOn that note, you may have seen an exciting announcement last week about a new strategic investment and partnership with Gig Wage, which for those who may not be familiar, is a very impressive and fast-growing start-up, focused on creating a better financial ecosystem for the rapidly expanding gig economy. I met Gig Wage's founder Craig lewis, earlier this year, it quickly became clear that we have similar goals and visions for the industry and for our customers and that we could do a lot together. Green Dot Led Gig Wage's Series A funding round, and we will serve as their infrastructure bank partner, enabling Gig Wage to launch a number of new financial solutions designed for 1,099 workers and their employers. As a strategic investor and BaaS partner, Green Dot has an exciting opportunity to grow this vertical and capitalize on the growing demand for better banking and payment solutions for the Gig economy. Also, we have a few new partners we will be announcing soon. Brands that everyone will know and recognize. One thing I want to reiterate is our commitment to partnering with Select high-impact and high-potential companies, meaning they are highly respected brands with very impressive reach or their start-ups with tremendous potential, which we will differentiate ourselves as a BaaS provider by acting, not just as a bank sponsorship, but also a true partner, providing end-to-end support, spanning technology, program management, call center support, fraud and our retail network and more.\nWhich we consider a huge differentiator of Green Dot. Last but certainly not least, one of the most important and exciting areas of focus and progress has been unlocking our potential as a powerful challenger bank. Earlier this year, one of the goals I set for the company was to introduce a new direct-to-consumer bank, and that vision will come to fruition very soon. Last week, we officially launched our wait list for go-to bank, which is an entirely new and simplified digital banking experience that will offer meaningful value and features designed to save people time and money and manage and move money effortlessly. We chose go-to bank as our new brand by doing some pretty extensive research and because we want this product to be the go-to destination for modern banking and money movement for everyone wherever they go. Go-to will be a solution designed primarily for low to moderate-income consumers who are looking for and can benefit from a better way to bank and transact. And we plan to expand the target market as we enhance the product features and services over time.\nAs one of the only challenger banks to actually be a bank, Go-to bank will position Green Dot to compete aggressively and profitably. When we launch early next year, Go-to will offer a compelling value proposition to a wide range of customers, including the security and protection that comes with a member FDIC bank, an intuitive mobile app and experience where you can quickly set up and manage your account, no monthly fees when we use direct deposit, free in network ATMs, 10 times national average API and other valuable features and rewards. And our plan is to expand on those features quickly. This new brand and product set represent a meaningful and long-term commitment and strategy for Green Dot. So you can expect to see a lot more of this in 2021 and beyond. While we intend to spend to develop the Go-to bank brand and acquire customers, our marketing dollars will be based on a data-driven marketing strategy driven by thoughtful and rigorous return on investment requirements and expectations for lifetime value. Green Dot has a proud 20-year history of serving over 33 million customers through our retail direct-to-consumer products and many more through our banking partners like Walmart, Apple, Uber and other well-known innovative brands.\nWe know how to build products that make money movement and access more seamless, intuitive and safe for everyone. We also know there is a significant segment of our population that continues to be underserved by the financial services industry, and we have the opportunity to change that with Go-to bank. I encourage you to visit Go-to-bank.com and join our wait list. As you may be able to tell, we have been incredibly busy laying the foundation to deliver value-added products and services to our customers, directly as well as through our valuable BaaS partners. At the same time, we are delivering on our commitment to rightsize the cost structure and establish sustainable operating leverage, which will create value to you, our shareholders. I would like to thank our valuable employees who have been working tirelessly through these challenging times.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it over to Jess to walk through our numbers.\nJess Unruh -- Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer\nThanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. Overall, Green Dot had strong financial results in the quarter and significantly exceeded our internal expectations from three months ago. The momentum we saw in Q2 from stimulus funds, unemployment benefits, and new users on the platform carried into Q3. We are pleased that the scale of our platform and our market reach puts us in a position to benefit from the accelerated adoption of digital payments. Our Q3 2020 non-GAAP revenue grew 22% to $279 million, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $34 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.25. We experienced a few significant tailwinds as well as headwinds in the quarter that I'll walk you through. Overall, we were pleased with the strength of the consolidated performance. Focusing on our top line results for a moment, non-GAAP revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by our account programs, with strong performance in key metrics such as account acquisition, gross dollar volume and purchase volume.\nThe growth in gross dollar volume was driven in part by the extension of federal unemployment benefits and higher levels of tax refund deposits onto our account programs due to the extension of the tax filing deadlines to July 2020. Altogether, this resulted in increased management service fees from our BaaS partners, increased monthly maintenance fees from elevated deposit balances and growth in interchange revenue. Consistent with the previous quarter, the interchange rate we earned was down year-over-year in Q3 due to a 30% increase in the average ticket size per transaction. Since interchange fees have both fixed and variable components, we earned smaller fees in percentage terms on larger transactions, partially offsetting the increase in revenue in our account segment was an increase in cash rewards related to Green Dot unlimited accounts. We also experienced revenue growth in our money movement services, primarily due to a 9% growth in the number of cash transfers, a significant growth in tax refunds processed from the shift in the tax filing deadline and continued growth in new tax processing services we introduced this year.\nPartially offsetting this growth was a year-over-year decline in simply paid disbursement transactions as a result of the disruption in the ridesharing business from the effects of COVID-19. Another headwind discussed on prior calls was the year-over-year decline in net interest income due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances as a result of rate cuts by the Federal reserve earlier this year. Let me turn my attention to our expenses and margins. Our total non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 grew by $42 million or 20% year-over-year, and our margins expanded approximately 100 basis points. Sales and marketing expenses declined by 5% due to lower marketing expenses year-over-year. Our marketing spend in 2019 was heavily concentrated in the back half of the year, whereas we are spreading the spend more evenly across 2020. The lower marketing expense was partially offset by an increase in revenue share with our partners, including an increased revenue share rate associated with last year's renewal of the Walmart Moneycard program. Compensation and benefits expenses increased 18% due to incentive compensation for our employees. Consistent with our commentary on our prior earnings call, we've reinvested some of our planned SG&A saves to incentivize and reward our nonexecutive employees for their extraordinary efforts to serve our customers and execute on our priorities as we navigate through the pandemic. Processing expenses increased 60%, in line with corresponding revenue increase in our BaaS fees and interchange revenue.\nOther general and administrative expenses increased to 43%, mainly as a result of an increase in transactional losses from higher volumes of customer disputes. In Q2, we experienced a significant increase in transaction losses primarily due to operational disruptions caused by COVID-19. In Q3 and likely for the remainder of this year, the basis points of loss on transactions will be a headwind to margins as we continue to work diligently on improving the customer experience and align our fraud prevention processes with the industry's best practices and performance. We expect loss rates will begin to normalize in 2021. Depreciation expense in Q3 increased to 15% year-over-year due to increased capitalization development costs over the past several years to support our strategic initiatives. We expect depreciation expense to increase in the short-term and then begin to flatten out as we reduced the level of overall spend on development by consolidating some of our products and focusing on prioritizing our development based on strategic impact and incremental operating margins. From a liquidity perspective, we generated $37 million of operating cash flow during Q3 and $199 million year-to-date. Our cash at the holding company at quarter end was $152 million. The $100 million revolver is available to us should be needed to invest in strategic initiatives. Now I'd like to focus on expectations for the remainder of the year. As we look ahead, while our business remains very healthy, it is important to remember that Q2 benefited from approximately $2 billion of gross dollar volume from stimulus funds and Q3 had a follow-on benefit from elevated deposits.\nAdditionally, Q2 and Q3, in aggregate, benefited from approximately $2 billion of incremental federal unemployment benefits afforded under the Cares Act. While we are well positioned to continue to benefit from the accelerated adoption of digital payments, we expect our KPIs to continue to normalize that stimulus disbursements roll off and the enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. While each of account acquisition, gross dollar volume and purchase volume were in Q3, above long-term historical trends, we do anticipate that normalization will occur throughout Q4 2020. One item to note for Q4 is that we expect a year-over-year decline in cash transfers. We decided to not renew an agreement with a large reload partner because of proposed renewal terms and associated margins did not meet our expectations. Thus, our cash transfer volumes and the related topline revenue will be impacted.\nBut given the lower profitability of this contract, we actually expect the overall percentage contribution margin in our money processing channel to improve. As we think about the full year 2020, we expect our non-GAAP revenues will be in the range of $1.175 billion to $1.185 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $195 million to $200 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2. These ranges do not anticipate another significant federal stimulus program nor do they anticipate a further economic slowdown from the impact of COVID-19. In conclusion, we remain focused on reducing the overall complexity of our operations with the goal of generating consistent operating leverage in the years to come. We believe decisions made this year will begin to benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Speaking of 2021, we expect to provide formal guidance for the year when we report our Q4 2020 results in February. While we're still in our budget process, we would like to provide some insights for you to consider as you build your models. First, we will have positive impact from initiatives discussed earlier, including new BaaS partnerships and Go-to bank as well as various costs and capital efficiencies. We will also have year-over-year headwinds associated with the government benefits that positively impacted our 2020 results, as we discussed earlier. We look forward to providing a more detailed discussion on our next earnings call.\nWith that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRobert Paul Napoli -- William Blair & Company -- Analyst\nThank you. Good afternoon. Bob. Lot going on. Just maybe a first question, just on direct deposit. And I mean the -- your prior roles. I mean, direct deposit was a big focus. I know it's a big focus here. The penetration rate currently is about 40% on direct deposit accounts. Is there a strategy around building the direct deposit customer base at a faster rate? If so, what is it and what kind of a penetration rate or other metrics would you judge with the success of that program on?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes, Bob, I think your question, I think, illustrates the knowledge and awareness of like from what we do. The direct deposit customer is extremely valuable customer. So as we -- when we launch our challenger Bank initiative early next year, we will be very focused on driving that direct deposit growth with that product. So in terms of any sort of metrics or levels of success, can't give those to you at this point? But yes, it's going to be a cornerstone to our strategy and our focus on growth.\nRobert Paul Napoli -- William Blair & Company -- Analyst\nGreat. And then maybe just as a follow-up, the new partners, it sounds like you have a pipeline of new large and small partners, as you mentioned, start ups and well-known brands. Is there a different approach to those new partners versus what Green Dot has had in the past or is it more partnership as we view? And would this generate higher ROIs maybe than some of the partnerships in the past?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nNo. The approach file is different. And I don't know what was shared publicly, but from my understanding is or my approach is very much of a quality instead of a quantity in terms of partners. And if you think about what we have at Green Dot, we have a very unique collection of assets. I mean I'll say right now, I don't like the bath acronym for us because we do a lot more than just give access to our bin, so I think banking as a service. We can bring to our partners -- our partnerships a bank. We can bring logistic expertise in terms of insulin plastic. We've got a tech stack. We have a reload network. We have customer service call centers, management expertise. We've got fraud management expertise. So we bring a whole collection of services. And so our new approach is not to just let any fintech come along and kind of take us one piece at a time of our service, but more look for large partners, like many of the ones we have that are looking for kind of an all-encompassing solution and relationship, work to deepen that relationship and bring powerful products and solutions that really nobody else can offer because nobody else has a collection of the assets we have, bring those to large partners who can really drive scale for us in adoption of the masses with those solutions. And then on the other side of the spectrum, more partnerships with companies like Gig Wage. It's -- Craig, Lewis, the CEO of that and founder of that business, he's a tremendous entrepreneur, a hard charging. He's built a great low platform. He's got some great prospects in terms of a growing wave of the Gig economy. And we want to play in that, and we see being able to invest in a company like Gig Wage, truly be their partner and help them grow and grow with them in the Gig economy. That's the strategy we want to do on our partner approach. So as I said, what I just read is it's either large partners with tremendous reach, are small, very powerful partners with tremendous growth potential.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from George Sutton of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Frederick Sutton -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst\nCongratulations to me. I'm the latest wake less customer for the new Challenger Bank offering. So I\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nGo to bank. We will be your go to bank for all your seamless and frictionless financial services. So glad to have you on board.\nGeorge Frederick Sutton -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst\nIf you can handle all my wife needs, very impressed. So question competitively. Goldman Sachs just announced entrance into the bass market. Axos had to give up a customer because they had reached two large a size and couldn't work with rev share. I think Goldman will have the same issue. So curious how you're -- and I happy that you're defining some of your capabilities a little bit more specifically. But I'm curious, competitively, when I look at that larger landscape and issues that some might run into. And then look at the sort of some of the bigger opportunities in the space. Just help us understand when you're building up this pipeline how competitive it is. And I would also like to add, and I don't need a follow-up question. So this will be my follow-up question. The renewal deal that you didn't go forward with and how that demonstrates customers you might be moving away from?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nSure. So the renewal we passed on was with a partner that was only using our reload network. And so we -- what we saw there was somebody who was demanding high volume in service with next to no margin, sometimes negative margin, and we were not willing to go there. Especially, as I said, they were just doing an a la carte solution where all they wanted to use was our reload network. So I will walk from that partner. In terms of the other thing, your other question in regards to how we -- as our bank grows with all these new partners, how do we maintain the asset level. Really don't want to get into a lot of detail on that, but other just to share that we're very confident that as we structure our business, Greg Cores, who's now the CEO of our bank. We can run our bank. We can stay below the $10 billion asset level for a long, long time with very significant volume coming across our institution. And if you compare that with, say, a Goldman Sachs bank or whatever banks are out there now jumping on the BaaS wagon. Those banks are entirely different types of banks than we are. Those are traditional financial institutions that do all sorts of banking and lending, and they want to be $300 million, $400 billion in assets. And so that's -- they will have a different issue, and we'll be able to protect our revenue with higher interchange by maintaining our $10 billion or less asset size.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of Truth Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew William Jeffrey -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nI wonder if I could maybe build on Bob's question with regard to -- I guess, more specifically with regard to unit economics, taking a look at the go-to bank site, maybe a little bit behind, George, as far as getting on the wait list, but I'll get there. And looking at cash back and some other products, the consumer incentives seem competitive quite rich, and I appreciate the focus on direct deposit. Dan, can you just give us some comfort that these are really good ROI products despite whether it's 6% or 7% cash back? Those are pretty those are pretty juicy returns or rewards, I should say.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nI'm really glad to hear you ask that question, but that kind of -- what will be almost skepticism, right? No, seriously because...\nAndrew William Jeffrey -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nI'm also Skeptical often OK.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nI know how you make your living. I know. Absolutely. The economics on this product are going to be stronger than, I think, any product that we have at Green Dot currently. And now 6% and 7% cash back rewards, those returns are funded by the merchants who are issuing those reward programs. So those won't come as a cost to us. So it's really about how we can be creative and designing really value which opportunities, propositions for the consumer that they love and embrace, and we still preserve the very good economics on our product.\nAndrew William Jeffrey -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. I mean, as a follow-up, I guess, I'll press my luck again as a skeptic. With a product that -- for example that hasn't been announced, but we got maybe a little bit of a sneak peak around yesterday, the Amazon Flex product. I mean, do you feel like -- and that's just one example. I mean, do you feel like there's a there's a means of pressing the advantage over the long-term in terms of getting customers like that to participate in funding rewards? I mean that's, obviously, a clear positive. I just wonder if you can frame up if that's a sort of sustainable economic model, given the size of the customers.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes. I think that's just an example of the sort of things that we're going to want to explore with our partners. And it's part of our new approach around our partner strategy of how can we create compelling solutions. Let's say, if we have a partner who is a retailer, we have a bank, we have the ability to -- we can open up with very little friction, a digital wallet that can reside in the apps of our partners. That's what we do now. And we could create credit building tools for consumers, with our partners. We can actually even create small low-risk loan products with our partners. We can, together with our partners, just as you mentioned, create rewards products for the consumers. So that's where -- I get really excited about what we're doing here is if you think about with go-to bank. We are very focused in creating powerful products and solutions for our direct-to-consumer business. Those products and solutions that we create we can easily expand and offer those to our partners, whereas we can in the market and we can reach a couple 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 million] customers on our own. We can take some of the products and solutions that we have created, bringing us all our partners, and we can then be reaching consumers in the tens of hundreds of millions at a time. So yes, you're spot on in terms of -- from a long-term perspective of being able to work with and engage with these partners, we have the opportunity to reach a very, very large number of consumers in this country.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey Clark El-Assal -- Barclays Bank PLC -- Analyst\nI wanted to ask you about 1,099 and Gig economy and the opportunity for the company. I mean, given your investment in Gig Wages, the Amazon product, you already have an Uber product out there. Should we view this as sort of almost the primary opportunity for BaaS. When you talked about those kind of pipeline is full and potentially announcing new partners soon. Is this a real strategic pivot for the company kind of into that developing product specific to that kind of opportunity set?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nNo, it's not, Ramsey. It's not a pivot. It's not a new direction. It is, but it is an important growth channel for us. So I kind of -- I'd rather ride a wave in Paola Cano and so I look for waves. And to me, the Gig economy is wave. It's a growth wave. And so if we can if you think about our partnership with Uber, this investment in partnership with Gig Wage, other potential solutions that are out there. We're becoming well equipped to serve the Gig worker. Just as we are very well equipped to serve a loader modern income consumer, just as we are working to be very well equipped to serve a small business. And through that. And all of those avenues will leverage the common denominators that we have of a bank reload network, customer service, border controls, etc. So that's -- so it's absolutely -- it's a great question. I want to be clear, this is not a -- I'm not schizophrenic. This is not a switch or a pivot. It is a way to basically take these assets that we have. And the skills that we built over decades and how do we stack new opportunities on top of them to just drive incremental revenue with attractive margin.\nRamsey Clark El-Assal -- Barclays Bank PLC -- Analyst\nThat makes a ton of sense. My follow-up is on go to bank. And I'm just wondering if you could kind of encapsulate for us. What is different about this offering relative to other kind of prior mobile-first Green Dot products like Unlimited and Gobank? Is it more of the distribution? Is the product structure itself sort of different? I was just wondering if you could elaborate there a little bit.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes. Thank you for that question, Ramsey. It's -- the big difference is our commitment. And so Go-to bank is very different from all products that have been launched in the history of Green Dot because Go-to bank is it. Okay. From this point forward, there's no more NASCAR. There's no more puppy dog cards. There's no more unlimited cards, it's go to bank. And with go to bank, it's going to be go to savings, and there's going to be go to other solutions that are feature functionality tied to this go to bank account. For our consumer that we want to take this product. And by the way, it's a real bank account because it's issued by Green Dot bank. So it's not a marketing company who's hanging off of someone else has been this is a Go-to bank issue product so that we can -- we will really be able to create products and solutions to serve the full financial needs of our customers. So our goal here and our intent is, you will not be hearing a new product launch every single year from Green Dot. You will be hearing about future functionality additions to the Go Bank product on a regular basis for years to come.\nRamsey Clark El-Assal -- Barclays Bank PLC -- Analyst\nOkay, all right. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\nFirst question on new customer acquisition. So now that we have couple quarters post stimulus under our belt, wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of organic account growth in the quarter, for lack of a better kind of meaning. Are you seeing an elevated level of net new adds from non stimulus, non unemployment benefit customers? And any help there would be much appreciated.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nIt's a good question, Andrew. I think it's hard to really pull apart of what a stimulus and what is stimulus. I can say that we have seen an elevated amount of new customers coming into the system. And again, sort of hard to dissect whether they're coming in for non stimulus versus stimulus reasons. But yes, across Q2 and Q3, we saw a significant amount of new acquisition, both in retail and then the strength of the direct business, which is in part the better marketing efforts we have and the better cost per funded, but also in large part to additional stimulus funds and just the attractiveness of our products given this digital acceleration.\nAndrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Okay. That's good context. And then just my follow-up, maybe I'll ask it. There's a -- obviously, a lot of news about M&A out there. Dan, I was hoping to get your view about just philosophically, how you feel about scale acquisitions versus capabilities? Just philosophically, just interested to kind of get your viewpoint on just the M&A front?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nMy viewpoint in terms of what are we looking to grow through acquisitions or just like -- I'm not real clear what you're asking.\nAndrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\nYes. The question is, how much of a priority is M&A versus growing organically?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nGot it.\nAndrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\nAnd then within the -- and then for M&A, are you open to more scale acquisitions or would be more capability focused.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nGot it. Got it. So what I really like about what we have in front of us at Green Dot is we have real significant growth opportunities and potential without any acquisition. And I've always said that your ROE on organic growth is much higher than acquired growth. So I'm big fan and believer of organic growth if it comes with -- say it comes with a lot fewer problems. You're not trying to integrate a new culture or whatever out there. You know what you've got when you are signing customers and growing customers and landing on your existing infrastructure and you're using your core competency. So we don't need acquisitions to grow. So I want to make sure that's perfectly clear. However, from a standpoint of are we open? Absolutely. We're absolutely open to acquisitions that will enhance our functionality, accelerate our ability to grab some opportunities or just kind of incrementally add to our current volume. And so yes, we're -- and those would be from a small add-ons to larger that what might be even transformational.\nAndrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\nOkay, understood. Thanks, Dan.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Steven Kwok of KBW. Please go ahead.\nWai Ming Kwok -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\nThe first one I had was just around the early look into 2021. I know you called out roughly $4 billion of stimulus and unemployment benefit. Should we think of that as being routine a $40 million revenue headwind. If you just use like a roughly 1% exchange rate? And then as we've -- is there any early indications around like the -- what the margins on that could be. And you mentioned there's a positive headwind or positive tailwinds around the new businesses stuff like from -- as of right now, do you feel like those can offset essentially what the headwinds could be for next year?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nSure. Good question. Jess, do you want to take it or do you want me take that?\nJess Unruh -- Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer\nYes. Yes, I can take it. Look, I think there's been a lot of puts and takes associated with COVID in 2020. Portions of our business were negatively impacted. We had higher dispute call center costs. While other portions of our business were positively impacted by accelerated demand for digital payments and the government benefits and it's really hard to sort of isolate the direct impact of the government benefits specifically. So I think as you think about 2021, trends in gross dollar volume per active will really start to normalize from what you've seen in Q2 and Q3. Ultimately, we believe we'll be in a better place for long-term because of that digital adoption. And I think the -- I think about sort of what that GDV means, I think about it in GDV yield as opposed to necessarily just interchange because there's fees and other things associated with it. But we can speak more to our 2021 guidance on the next call.\nWai Ming Kwok -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\nGot it. And separately, there was an article out there around where perhaps buying the Credit Karma's tax business. I was just wondering, is this something that you guys would possibly look at? And separately, given that they would be helping input around that? I know you guys have a relationship with Intuit as well. Just wondering in terms of your relationships with Intuit, like how long of those contracts locked up for?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nI believe we announced that we recently renewed the Intuit contract. So we have a number of years now in that new contract remaining. We don't want to get in tax preparation business. So but there's -- we did -- that opportunity did come across the desk, but we've decided that that's not in our sweet spot of skills, capabilities and where we see our growth potential.\nWai Ming Kwok -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\nAll right, thanks for taking my question.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nAbsolutely. Thank you\nOperator\nThe next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGeorgios Mihalos -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nJust going to ask the ICT an ask two quick modeling questions and then I'll hop off. I guess the first, can you quantify or maybe I missed it, how much of an impact the nonrenewal from the retial partner will be? How much of an impact that's expected to have in the fourth quarter? And then the lower interchange yield, which I think was attributed to larger transaction size, would you expect that to sort of tick back up in the fourth quarter and sort of be more in line with what we've seen over the first half of 2020? And I'll hop off.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes. I'll take that one. So yes, on the latter question around interchange yield, we're already starting to see some of that normalize back to what we see in the past of, say, 120 basis points. So the further we get from those stimulus funds coming on, the more the interchange rate normalizing. To your first question around the reload partner. We're obviously focused on generating strong cash flows and margins. Sometimes, it means you need to walk away from deals. But I think of Q4, we expect cash transfer volume to be down year-over-year. We expect the margins of our money processing business to be up. And as we think about the future, we have a pretty active BD pipeline for new reload partners and tend to add new partners next year. And then as you think about Go-to bank in our consumer products in general and us bringing them back to health. As we grow our BaaS partnerships, etc, we believe the reload network profit and margin will improve despite losing some third-party reload volume because we make more money off of reloads on our own products that we do in our third-party products.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nI wanted to focus on the small business accounts. You talked about Intuit and Kabbage. I was just wondering if you could help. But if you can talk about how big that addressable market is and the strategy going forward? Do you expect to sign up -- work with more partners? Or is that also a strategy to go direct to -- and try to address the small businesses directly? And then finally, is the go-to bank being also the solution for the small business customers?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYes. Ashish, Go-to Bank is not the solution for the small business customers. However, if you think about a lot of small businesses in this country are sole proprietors and individuals. So the future functionality on got bank is very possible that small independent operators, sole providers may pick up our Go-to bank product and make it their account, but that's definitely not the intent or the design of the product. Our opportunity around small business in the country, I mean, it's very large. I mean, there's millions of small businesses in the United States. Our partner Quickbooks they had eight million small businesses alone that use their solution. So I think as we talked on the last call, I was in a press release, you could do research and see those numbers. But we are -- QuickBooks is operating QuickBooks cash account, which is basically a bank account that's operated by Green Dot Bank and we receive income off of that account. And we're very enthusiastic about that growth potential with QuickBooks. They can just -- 12%, 15% penetration into their base, will be one million customers, one million small business accounts on our platform. And similar opportunity with Kabbage, where we have a big account of debit card issues for Kabbage small businesses. With Kabbage now being part of American Express, the growth potential there, the marketing impact of American Express behind that product is very exciting. So I can't quantify it for you right now, but it is bigger than a bread box.\nAshish Sabadra -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThat's great. That's great. And maybe just a question on election outcomes and potential for a small second stimulus. How should we think about impact, if any, on the Green Dot just because a lot of the customers are unbanked, underbanked at the lower end of the Gig segment?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nWell, Green Hat customers by the nature of having green AP products are no longer unbanked. And so a stimulus -- another stimulus check would like the prior ones would be a positive to Green Dot, and be positive in the ways the others have been positive. It will be positive in the immediate term of just additional funds to our customers will come on to the account and will be spent and generate revenue for Green Dot, but it will also create additional impetus for cash-based consumers to adopt our product and engage in electronic payment methods. So -- which we believe is -- we believe and we are already benefiting from kind of a accelerated change in consumer behavior around electronic payments.\nAshish Sabadra -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThanks. That's very helpful.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYeah. Thank you. Ashish\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Brian Cantwell -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nDan, it's nice to see you guys performing well this quarter. Can I just touch on a couple of the key themes here by asking you two very simple questions, but I hope to get a serious response. First, can you tell us what are some of the learnings have been this past quarter as you're managing through this pandemic? Where are you growing more confident about Green Dot's revenue opportunity going forward? We've certainly noticed your comments about small businesses, which I think are very timely, for example, but where are you getting more confident? And where are you conversely thinking more dramatically about the company? And then I have a follow-up after that.\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nYou said you're going to ask the question and you hope to get, like, I think you said a serious or maybe a nonlipid answer. So I'm trying -- I mean I feel more confident about all areas of the company. It's -- I'm feeling we still have a lot of work to do. I will not -- I'm not going to sugarcoat that. We've got a lot of bad in grain habits that we have to change across the organization. But I'm feeling really a seismic shift inside the company to where -- we have a tremendous amount of talented people who really care about what we do or they care about doing a good job. And as we -- as myself and other leaders are providing a clear direction in terms of here is what we need to do and why and here's how we generate revenue and here is why margin is important. The light bulbs are going off and people are really starting to do the right thing. And I see we've got growth potential in all areas of our business. Even -- I'll pick on retail because I think everyone kind of believes just in America today, with the shift to some much being online is that retail as an entire sector. Across the economy is as a headwind. And so -- and for our business, I mean, we're not immune from the challenges as foot traffic is dropping in retailers. But we're in some very interesting conversations with a number of our retail partners now, how can we expand our footprint not just in their store, but into the daily lives of their consumers, how can we expand financial services and offerings to their customers and partnership. So I believe that we've got growth potential in our Paycard business and our tax business and our retail business, certainly in our direct-to-consumer business. And what I love about all that is you think about the competitive advantage that, that affords us in terms of striking out on powerful, disruptive large opportunities with a lot of our mass partners. We've got a bank all the assets have already ran a Relo network bank, call center operations, fraud controls, technology stack. All of those solutions are bought and paid for with our existing core businesses, which are all growing. And so now if we want to get creative and aggressive with some major partners, so we can collectively change the world, we've got that opportunity.\nJeffrey Brian Cantwell -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. That great color. And that leads to my follow-up. With go to bank, can you drill down a little bit for us on the strategy there for customer acquisition? I'm hearing you on the go-to bank value proposition, I'm understanding the strategic rationale for making this to go-to product. So Dan, if I'm a consumer in your 2020, I have a number of options, right? I have these newer bank options, I have traditional bank options and have Green Dot. So my question to you is -- and given all your experience in the industry, I want to ask if you can help investors understand how you're going to drive new customers to Green Dot?\nDan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nSure. I think that what's important to say and I've said it for the last 10 or 15 years, I mean, the total available market is tremendous, right? And it's not a zero-sum game. And so just as there is chase in Wells Fargo and Bank of America and Compass and BBVA, I mean, there is room for a significant number of FIs, if you will, offering solutions to consumers. And so we will market in our traditional fashion that we have done, we're going to do it much, in my opinion, we're going to do it better, smarter. We're going to do a significant amount of research. We spend our money effectively. We have a tremendous amount of research around the name Go-to bank and the design of Go-to bank and research around the products we're offering and how pricing them. We'll get a better return on every one of the marketing dollars that we spend. And I know this -- I just know this. I know this from my days at Netspend. I know this from sitting on the Board and being an investor in other prepaid companies over the years that you build a good solid product and you market it effectively, you will get your fair share of customers.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Eliason, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, and please go ahead, sir.\nMike Eliason -- Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations\nThanks, Justin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the KAR Global second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Today we'll discuss the financial performance of KAR Global for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. After concluding our commentary, we will take questions from participants.\nBefore Jim kicks off our discussion, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect KAR's business prospects and results of operations and such risks are fully detailed in our SEC filings. In providing forward-looking statements, the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update these statements.\nLet me also mention that throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the applicable GAAP financial measure can be found in the press release that we issued last night, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow, I'd like to turn this call over to KAR Global's CEO, Jim Hallett. Jim?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Michael and good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our call. The last time that we spoke, I was concerned about what changes would be needed for us to go forward. Today, I can tell you that I am genuinely excited to share with you what we have accomplished and how we have used this period of challenge to accelerate the transformation of our business. My agenda for today includes an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our operations throughout the world, I want to provide you with a review of our performance in the second quarter, including an overview of our monthly cadence within the quarter, provide an update on the performance of TradeRev. I will walk you through the actions that we have taken with our workforce and I want to close with an update on our progress in the digital transformation of our business and how I see this impacting our financial future performance.\nLet me start with the status of our operations throughout the world. In North America, all of our auction locations are open for business. The access to our physical auction sites varies by location. Where permitted, we are allowing our customers on site for previewing vehicles and in some cases bidding from inside the building. However, all of our vehicles are being sold through our digital platforms-OPENLANE, Simulcast, Simulcast+, and TradeRev. Over the last few months, we have signed up thousands of dealers on our digital platforms and tens of thousands of dealers have bought cars digitally that have never used our technology previously. This is probably one of our biggest accomplishments during the second quarter. We are not running any vehicles across the block at any of our physical auctions. We are providing ancillary services at all of our physical locations and restrictions on end-of-lease inspections and lot audits are minimal and our inspections businesses are back to full strength.\nThe one area that continues to lag is our repo business and that is handled by our PAR North American division. Our customers are not yet processing repossessions consistently in most areas. We expect the number of repos to begin returning to normal levels as we go into the third quarter.\nIn Europe, our operations are up and running. Our European businesses are all digital auction platforms. I would say the return to normal levels of activity has been a little bit slower in Europe than it has been in North America. And I would expect that our operations in Europe to be back to the prior year levels sometime in the third quarter.\nOur corporate offices continue to be open for essential activities. We are strongly encouraging our corporate employees to work from home as much as possible. I've been pleased with our ability to support the field, while our corporate office personnel are working remotely. While nobody anticipated that we would need to move many functions to a remote workforce, we were prepared when it was required and have met the needs of the organization without significant disruption at any level.\nNow, let me review our second quarter performance. First, I will say, it seems very odd for me to say that a 41% decline in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year was better than I expected. Vehicles sold in the ADESA segment declined 35% and the number of loan transactions at AFC declined 4% in the quarter. We also experienced declines in revenue per unit at physical auctions due to limitations on the services that we were permitted to offer from our physical locations and restrictions on our off-premise activities. Online-only revenue per vehicle increased slightly. We also saw declines in loan transaction units and revenue per unit at AFC. That's all led to a 42% reduction in our revenue.\nWith all that said, let me explain why the results were better than I expected. We started the quarter with all of our businesses shut down. We continue to have a small number of transaction [Technical Issues]. Volume was minimal at the beginning of April. Obviously, we were prepared for the disruption in our markets to continue and expected the recovery to be gradual and perhaps take through the remainder of the year. What actually happened was volumes picked up week-over-week, consistently beginning in mid-April and we saw this improve to where June volume was 8% above the prior year. And the values of used vehicles have continued to be strong. In fact, values are generally higher than we expected and this has supported the sellers using our auction platforms to move vehicles quickly. This is evident in the high conversion rates across all of our digital platforms.\nWe were cautious in calling employees back from furlough and we generated higher gross profit per transaction and increased adjusted EBITDA per vehicle sold in May and June. We progressed from losing money in April to seeing our performance in May improve, but still below prior year levels. And then we had a significant increase year-over-year in adjusted EBITDA in June. I'm encouraged by our performance late in the second quarter and heading into the third quarter. While we continue to see positive trends for the wholesale industry, it is too early to predict, with any level of confidence, how things will look a few months from now.\nWhat I can say is we accelerated the digital transformation of our business. We are selling 100% of our vehicles online. We have accelerated the pace of introducing new products, features and functions to support the digital marketplace and we have made permanent changes to our cost structure that should lead to improved gross profit and adjusted EBITDA margins going forward.\nNow, let me speak to TradeRev. Although the TradeRev network was able to operate when our physical auctions were shut down in early April, TradeRev saw volumes decline in April as retail activity was minimal. Like the rest of our business, we adjusted our workforce through furloughs, to bring the headcount in line with the sales activity. As the markets began to rebound in late April and early May, we found TradeRev could meet the needs of the market with fewer people. We maintained a disciplined approach during this recovery. We adjusted our processes, improved the leverage of our people in completing the imaging and the inspecting of vehicles and focused on assisting our customers with setting realistic pricing expectations.\nOur total TradeRev volume for the second quarter was down year-over-year, but this was primarily due to the extended shutdown in Canada. The recovery in Canada lagged the U.S. by about a month, and in June, we saw our Canadian volumes grow year-over-year. The bottom line is TradeRev was able to achieve better than breakeven results for each of May and June, and this includes the allocation of the combined sales team costs to TradeRev. We achieved 60% gross profit on revenue per unit that was approximately $350. Our conversion rate at TradeRev was well above 50% and our incentive costs were low. Now, that we have proven that the TradeRev model can be profitable and it can grow without heavy incentives, I want to focus on winning the digital dealer-to-dealer market.\nBefore I wrap up my comments, I want to give you a summary of the actions that we've taken with our workforce and where our headcount stands right now. As we entered the quarter, we had a little more than 15,000 employees. This includes both full-time and part-time. In early April, we furloughed about 11,000 employees worldwide. Every geography we served was impacted. At the time, most of the business activities were limited by stay-at-home orders and restrictions on business activities that were deemed non-essential. As all of us began to adjust to the new reality of a world experiencing a pandemic, we began to reopen our auction locations for limited activities and began recalling furloughed employees as needed. During the shutdown of our operations, we spent considerable time determining how we could adjust our process to meet the needs of our customers and maintain appropriate social distancing to protect our employees and our customers. And we have made many of these changes permanent in our operations.\nBy the end of the quarter, we called back about 5,000 employees and we identified 3,000 positions that are permanently eliminated. As of today, we still have about 2000 employees on furlough. We have notified these employees that while they remain on furlough, if they are not called back to work by October, their positions will be eliminated. The bottom line is, we have adjusted our cost structure to be much more lean. This is both direct cost of services and SG&A. We expect our business should generate higher gross profit margins and higher adjusted EBITDA margins going forward. While COVID-19 provided an unfortunate catalyst to make this change in a very compressed timeframe, our changes are consistent with KAR's strategic objectives that we reviewed with you at the beginning of the year.\nLet me conclude my commentary around the digital transformation of the industry. First, this has been a strategic vision for KAR that I have outlined over the past couple of years. Our focus on digital transformation of the wholesale auction industry prepared us to respond to COVID-19 situation aggressively and with a group of offerings that can meet the needs of both buyers and sellers in any market conditions. About two years ago, we migrated from our old technology to Simulcast in order to have a digital platform for selling vehicles from our physical locations. This investment was critical to us being able to move a 100% digital in less than a week, back in late March. We've been working on Simulcast+ for over a year and we had planned to pilot this platform by the end of 2020. We were able to accelerate this timing and we now have Simulcast+ in production. And you may have seen our recent announcement for our Hertz sale where we sold vehicles from 22 ADESA and Hertz locations, all within the same sale.\nWith Simulcast+, we can have multi-location sales that bring buyers from multiple geographies that have a specific interest in the vehicles that are being offered. This is a completely automated auction that uses a computerized auctioneer instead of a live auctioneer. We are able to provide additional functionality and flexibility while operating the most efficient platform in the industry and the results speak for themselves. Our conversion rate is above 60% on Simulcast+ platform and we can offer up to 120 cars per hour and the prices have been strong. We now have a digital platform that can serve every segment of the wholesale market: OPENLANE for the off-lease vehicle and other high-value used cars; TradeRev for the dealer-to-dealer transaction; Simulcast for transactions from our physical auction properties; and Simulcast+ for on-premise or off-premise auctions that can meet the needs of any seller, commercial or dealer.\nIn addition to having the platforms to meet the customer needs, we have also developed a lower cost operating model that has less labor costs. The lower labor cost is realized in reduced sale day costs. We have also streamlined our field SG&A and have streamlined our field support organization at ADESA. And we have reduced our corporate overhead costs by driving efficiency into our process for the back-office functions that support all of our businesses. COVID-19 caused us to take swift and drastic actions that accelerated the pace that we could drive change to the organization. We have made great progress in permanently eliminating significant people costs from the organization, and we have other opportunities as well. We are looking at further centralization of functions throughout our business to drive even more efficiency.\nExamples of the areas that we are focusing on are vehicle inspections, title processing, and checkout processes. We will continue to look for technology to improve everything from customer interfaces to the back-office support. I'm excited about the progress that we have made over the past three months, and I'm even more excited about the opportunities I see in the future, although, the second-quarter results does not paint a clear picture of where we are today due to the impact of COVID-19 on our business, especially at the beginning of the quarter. The progression of our performance, month-to-month, through the quarter, gives me confidence that the benefits of lower direct labor costs and reduced overhead are expected to be evident in our results immediately, beginning with the third quarter.\nThank you again for your support of KAR through the most challenging period any of us have seen in our professional careers. Our balance sheet is strong and we are properly positioned to support our growth initiatives going forward. The entire KAR Global team is focused on delivering exceptional results now and beyond in the post-COVID period. And finally, let me say thank you to every employee within the KAR organization that has made personal and financial sacrifices so that KAR could be in a position to be a leader in technology and innovation in the wholesale auction industry.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Eric for additional commentary before we take your questions.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Jim. As Jim just pointed out in his remarks, the second quarter has been an unusual three-month period. Let me start by confirming that KAR is not providing guidance for 2020 or any future periods at this time. Retail used car sales have been strong, even above prior year levels recently. There are any number of things that could impact our industry through the remainder of the year. There is uncertainty around how the spread of COVID-19 will impact businesses in the U.S., Canada and Europe. It is clear that opening up for business as usual is not imminent throughout the geographic regions where we operate.\nUnemployment continues to be high in the U.S. and many businesses, including the used car retail industry are somewhat dependent on government support to maintain their current operations. We also believe the government stimulus packages in the United States have helped the consumer and enhanced used car activity. Without continued government stimulus in the United States, it is possible that current level of used car activity would slow significantly. I will say, we are set up well for the third and fourth quarter to be much better than the second quarter. While the recovery from COVID-19 shutdowns in Canada and Europe have lagged the recovery in the U.S., we are seeing significant increases in activity in Canada and Europe very recently. Activity in Canada has reached pre-COVID levels in July. Europe is still lagging the recovery in North America, but we are seeing results that we're approaching 75% of the prior year early in the third quarter, and there are signs that the recovery will continue in the second half of the year. We do expect significantly reduced cash taxes as a result in 2020. We also have delayed or canceled a number of capital projects that will result in lower capital expenditures than we expected at the beginning of the year.\nWith that said, the recovery in our business has given us confidence in moving forward on some projects in the second half of the year that we had put on hold in the second quarter. The one thing that is evident from our performance late in the second quarter, we believe, we will have higher gross profit margins, operating margins, and adjusted EBITDA margins going forward. And as Jim mentioned, we believe the changes in our cost structure are permanent and will continue in a post-COVID-19 business environment.\nJim provided you with a summary of changes in our headcount. Let me put some numbers behind those facts. The elimination of 3,000 positions will reduce our total compensation expense on an annual basis by approximately $90 million. This is a combination of direct labor and SG&A. Please keep in mind that the job eliminations include both full and part-time positions. Our total severance for these job eliminations is approximately $6 million.\nNow, let me cover a couple of topics that impacted our financial results in the second quarter. First, we recorded a write-off of goodwill and other intangibles totaling $29.8 million. Annually, we review the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets throughout all KAR business units. This year, this evaluation coincided with the time period we were reacting to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations. We completed this evaluation and determined that there were no impairments of intangible assets in any of our business units, except for ADESA U.K. In ADESA U.K., we have seen changes in the U.K. dealer network that changes the outlook for the U.K. business in the near term. As a result, we have written off all of the goodwill and a portion of intangible assets in the second quarter for ADESA U.K.\nAnother item of note in our second quarter performance is the level of loan losses at AFC. Our provision for loan losses increased to 4.3% of average managed receivables for the quarter. We have continued to see strong credit performance throughout our portfolio. Our current credit statistics cause me to believe we will lower provisions for credit losses in the second half of 2020. The portfolio is down almost $600 million since year-end. Delinquencies are relatively low and absent an adverse change in the used car retail industry, we expect loan losses could be lower for the remainder of the year.\nOne major change in our operations since our last earnings call that is worth highlighting is the cash we were able to generate in the business following the negative cash flow in April. For the quarter, we were able to generate positive cash from operating activities. You may recall from our May earnings call that we had used $150 million of available cash in the month of April. We were able to increase our available cash balance by $50 million in the month of May and an additional $150 million in June, excluding the capital raised in the pipe transaction.\nAt June 30, our available cash balance was approximately $875 million. We closed July with over $1 billion in available cash. We have strengthened the company's capital structure and we believe we are well-positioned to get through any future issues we may face.\nObviously, our improved capital position is in part due to the $550 million private investment completed in June. Our new investors, Apax Partners and Periphas Capital have closed on the issuance of $550 million of convertible preferred stock. The preferred stock is convertible into common at $17.75 per share. The terms were disclosed in Form 8-Ks that we filed in May and June and will be included in our Form 10-Q that will be filed today. At the time we were evaluating private investments in KAR, we were concerned about having adequate capital to navigate the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic that materially impacted our business. While we have seen improved results since the completion of this transaction, we are in a much better position to accelerate the digital transformation of our business with the balance sheet strength that we have today.\nIn terms of capital allocation, we have some limitations in the near term created by the amendment of our revolving credit facility. This amendment puts restrictions on acquisitions, payments of dividends, and share repurchases. We plan to use our capital to fuel future growth and create shareholder value. We continue to focus on our current operations and the continued digital transformation of our business. As the outlook for used vehicle, retail and wholesale markets becomes clear over the next few quarters, we will be setting our priorities for capital allocation going forward. At this time. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is our priority.\nThat concludes my commentary. I will turn it back to Justin so we can take your questions, and thank you for joining us today.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nAnd thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi, thanks for taking my question and thanks for the additional disclosure on the intra-quarter trend in volume too which was helpful this quarter. Are you able to comment on the trend subsequent to the quarter in July? Are volumes set to exceed the 8% year-over-year growth in June?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Ryan, good morning, and welcome, and thank you for your question. Listen, we're obviously very, very pleased with the results that we saw in June. I would tell you, as we go through July, prices remained strong, conversion rates remained strong and we expect the business to continue to do well in -- as we go into the third quarter.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd as I mentioned, Ryan, we're starting to see a pickup in Europe, which is also going to add. That volume number in June was a consolidated worldwide number. So Canada and Europe are really picking up and that will trigger some more growth as well.\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks. And I know you're not providing guidance, but are you able to discuss some of the puts and takes on volume in the back half, specifically relative to rental car dispositions? And also I think there is some sense of maybe some of the lease returns were deferred and could be coming back and curious to your outlook for repossessions. On the GM and Ford calls, they talked about delinquency as being really very low, almost record lows, which is surprising, but maybe supported by some of the government cash payments, which could be expiring or subsiding. Do you think that there will be an uptick there? How does that all sort of net out to volume in the back half do you think?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So, Ryan, I think your assessment there is probably in line with what we would say on repossessions. Repossessions really haven't started to show up yet. And we think it's as a result of certain restrictions that were put on financial companies from being able to go and repossess cars especially in this climate that we're dealing with right now. So I think there's a good opportunity that the repossessions will start flowing here as we enter into the third quarter and it will certainly have an impact on our volumes throughout the balance of this year.\nRental car is very, very interesting. Rental has always been our smallest segment in terms of the commercial cars we sell. And I mentioned in my commentary, the Hertz situation and that's been a win for us, especially using our Simulcast+ product that I talked about as well. We're seeing a little bit more rental business from some of the other rental car companies. So, I would say, there would be a small uptick there. And we're seeing very good success. TradeRev continues to grow and cars are being sold at physical auctions. It continue to be positive as well. So, overall, I would say that as we look at all of our volume in the different segments and where it comes from, I feel good about the balance of the year as we go into the second half here. And I think, barring something unforeseen that Eric spoke about in his comments, we would expect to see a good finish to the year.\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay and then just last quick question...\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Ryan, if I...\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nYeah.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIf I could, because a lot of investors ask us this. We expect very strong off-lease returns, whether it be through deferrals, but there is also a large number of lease maturities in the second half going back and looking at 2017 lease originations. We expect rental car to be a contributor to our industry. We are doing very well on repossessions. But it will grow because they've been lighter. Dealer consignment -- while July was very good for us, consolidated dealer consignment was up quite a bit year-over-year. That's the area -- with the retailers being so light on inventory, they're retailing more trades that could be tight, but we think that it will grow year-over-year for us. So that -- I just wanted to give a summary walking through the different segments. I do think, though, that the next six months have more visibility. It's still pretty murky looking into 2021 beyond the off-lease area where we know there's a lot of lease returns. How that will do is highly dependent on unemployment figures in the economy.\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay, that's very helpful. Thank you. If I could just slip in one lastly on liquidity. I mean, it really is quite plentiful now. I wonder if it's even reasonable to ask if maybe you are overcapitalized, particularly given the better than expected improvement in the end market and in your own execution. Was some of the capital raised maybe motivated by anything other than conservatism such as desire for a strategic acquisition, etc? How should we think about that now large cash pile?\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, Ryan, again, having $1.9 billion of debt and now $1 billion of cash, I would not describe it as overcapitalized. I might describe it as generously capitalized and when we raised the line, we did -- to be honest, we did not expect the quick recovery that we had, especially in June. And the good news is we're in a period of transformation, where that capital increases our confidence in aggressively pursuing the digital transformation of our industry. Jim, did you want to add anything to that?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I would just say, Ryan, as we've said many times, none of us saw this coming and we saw 90% of our business disappear overnight. And I referred to it in terms of -- this was shock and awe, right? And we were quite concerned about just the financial stability of the company and it was, I guess, as I looked at it, it was like taking an insurance policy to make sure that we had the liquidity and we had this financial strength to get through whatever we were going to have to deal with, not knowing how long this was going to last. So obviously we went out and we had a very strong interest in the company. And I think you asked a little bit about something to the effect about what else, kind of, what we are thinking about with that. I think we were thinking about, number one, we wanted to get the best economic outcome that we could for our investors. We had put a limit of a maximum of 20% dilution on that.\nBut we were also looking for an investor who understood our strategy and an investor who we felt and believed would support our strategy. And then, also, we wanted to take a look at who had experience in this digital space, who had taken digital product -- who had taken brick and mortar products into a digital transformation. And at the end of the day, along with the money, I think we checked all those boxes and we feel very, very good about the investment that we took and the partners that we got.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd I'll close, Ryan, with one thing. That capital was raised with our long term future in mind. It was not a short term Band Aid. It did give us confidence, but we never intended for the capital we raised to be used for operations in 2020. It was a long term view with how we can create shareholder value over a period of time.\nRyan Brinkman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nVery helpful, thank you.\nOperator\nAnd thank you. And our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nYarden Amsalem -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. This is Yarden Amsalem on for John.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nYarden Amsalem -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nI guess, just as first question, in terms of your independent dealer buyers, we saw recent demand for used vehicles improve significantly throughout the quarter, but there were still some pressure on credit performance at AFC. So, can you discuss the state of your smaller dealer buyers and to what extent do you think potential losses at AFC can continue?\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThat's a good question. We're actually seeing very strong performance in the AFC portfolio, which is predominantly independent used car dealers that are smaller in size. And our credit statistics are looking quite good. We did recognize loan losses in the first and second quarter, given the pandemic. And I would hope that, as the year plays out, you will find that we were conservative in our approach in the first half of the year. But at this point in time, what we've done is taken very careful look at the portfolio at potential losses, recognized them early. However, the delinquencies and the performance of the portfolio, I would argue, is stronger than the picture painted by the credit losses recognized in the first half. And we'll see how that plays out the rest of the year.\nI am concerned about government stimulus providing the strength to keep these dealers in business. And if that slows, or if we reduce the amount of stimulus, I do think, you would probably see more pressure on the small independent dealer and we're prepared for that.\nYarden Amsalem -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you. I guess, my second question, can you talk about the trend with online-only revenue per vehicle in the quarter and your expectations for the rest of the year? I mean, do you think ARPU on a consolidated basis can -- will likely remain at current levels, or could it actually trend positively, I guess, toward the second half of 2020?\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe are seeing it trend positively month-to-month right now and it's primarily because of ancillary services are continuing to grow. Those were -- ancillary services were the deepest cut in our business. We couldn't do anything to a car, other than sell it early in the quarter and that's coming back. And I think one of the misconceptions I hear from investors is that, as it goes online, you're going to reduce the transaction revenue from selling the vehicle. Well, that just isn't true. Our Simulcast and Simulcast+ products are able to maintain the same auction revenue per transaction that we're getting when we had the physical auction. There is no reductions in the fees and the mix is right. And the other thing that's really powerful, the conversion rates we're getting because of the all-digital platforms is actually driving higher gross profit. That's what's doing it. High conversion rates are really good because we're getting great leverage off of a fixed cost infrastructure in the technology. Jim, do you have anything you want to add?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nI think you got it, Eric.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOkay.\nYarden Amsalem -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nI guess, relatedly, if [Indecipherable] prices remains strong through the end of the year, do you expect conversion rates can actually improve in 3Q and 4Q?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, conversion rates are well above historic norms. And I would be excited just to maintain those conversion rates as we get through the fourth quarter. Would we take an increase? Indeed, we would. But I'm not sure how much higher the conversion rates can go than where they are right now.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nBut you are correct. Strong pricing supports the sellers selling the cars quickly and that's high conversion rate. They don't run it twice because they know they got a great price and that looks like a trend that is continuing right now.\nYarden Amsalem -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you so much. That's all I had.\nOperator\nAnd thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is now open.\nCraig Kennison -- Baird -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my questions as well. Jim, you mentioned you're 100% digital now in terms of auctions. Is the traditional in-person auction dead? And if so, how does that change your real estate needs?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nCraig, great question and one that has a lot of conversation going around that. I would say that -- to answer your question outright, the traditional brick and mortar auction is not dead, it continues. But I would tell you from the KAR standpoint, we are very focused on digital transformation. We are very focused on all of our platforms and being able to serve all of our customers from a digital standpoint. As I said in my commentary, we have sold 1.5 million cars in the first half of the year. Right? And in the last quarter, I think, we sold 600,000 and quite frankly in the last quarter, none of those vehicles ran through a physical auction. None of those vehicles went through a lane. And I think we've demonstrated to our customers the real value proposition here. Not only is it efficient and certainly saves time and saves money and expense, it also is getting them more access to more vehicles.\nThere is a much broader reach with these platforms, as I think I may have mentioned in the Hertz sale, although, that sale was kind of from one location, there is 22 locations and we sold those vehicles in the 19 different states. That doesn't happen at an independent auction or one auction site that you get that kind of reach. So from my standpoint, I would hope that we demonstrated to our customers this is the way of the future. This is what we're seeing in other businesses. This was something that has always been my vision, something that I always believe would take place at some point in time. And if we can create the outcome that our customers are looking for, I don't believe there's any reason for KAR to go back to running cars through the lane.\nWith that, you asked about real estate, I would tell you real estate is one of the most important assets that we have. Real estate is still important. We still need to inventory these cars, we need to inspect them and image them. We need to get them launched onto our platforms. There is the ancillary services that I already talked about, those still need to be done. I just think that real estate in the traditional brick and mortar auction within the KAR organization is going to play a different role.\nCraig Kennison -- Baird -- Analyst\nThanks. And the second question has to do with TradeRev. You said you are focused on winning in the dealer-to-dealer channel, now that you've proven the TradeRev could be profitable. I'm curious, I guess, does that mean you're prepared to go back to subsidies to drive market share in TradeRev or do you think you can both win market share, and forgo any subsidies?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So we have no desire to go back to the incentives that you speak of from the past. We're going to continue to run this business. I think we've demonstrated the discipline in running the business and on sound footing and running the business on the value that you're delivering to your customer and getting paid for that is critical. We've demonstrated that we can make money. I mentioned we had record months in May and June. Now, that's not to say that we won't ramp up our marketing spend over time, but the way we ramp up our marketing spend will not be through incentives. It will Technical Issues] be through more sales and marketing and promoting the platform itself and the value of the platform. So we're feeling very good about our position.\nI'll just expand a little bit, Craig, and say I think the thing that we need to understand here, if you take all the competitors in this space, it's probably still selling less than 1 million cars. We're in the very, very early innings of this space. We know that we are not the leader in this space, but I can tell you, we also know that we are now profitable and we have a collection of assets like nobody else, unmatched in the industry, and I am absolutely certain that we can focus on that leadership position and with -- as we go forward, we will close that gap. My eyes are on the price.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd, Craig, I'll just add one thing. We aren't competing for the dealer-to-dealer transaction with TradeRev. We're competing with KAR. Jim mentioned that collection of assets is unmatched, it's everything we do, the capabilities from all of our platforms are available to that dealer.\nCraig Kennison -- Baird -- Analyst\nWell said. Thank you very much.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWelcome.\nOperator\nAnd thank you. And our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust [Phonetic]. Your line is now open.\nStephanie Benjamin -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Stephanie.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning, Stephanie.\nStephanie Benjamin -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nI did want to follow up on that last question on TradeRev that you mentioned in your prepared remarks about, I guess, discrepancy in recovery between Canada and the U.S. Could you maybe talk about what you saw as Canada started to improve or maybe break out when TradeRev in the U.S. start really to pick up? Just some more intra-quarter detail would be helpful as we, kind of, can then use that to look at performance in the back half.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Stephanie, Canada basically kept a near complete shutdown, almost a month longer than most of the U.S., and so -- but I will say the Canadian recovery was much quicker once it started. I mean, they really came out of the gate fast and that's because TradeRev is the leading dealer-to-dealer platform in Canada, without question. And so when the dealers were still light on, call it, in-person activity, they were using that platform. So it was great that we had it. And it really picked up late in the last week of May to early June, but the pace at which it recovered was much quicker, where the U.S. started picking up in mid-April and was a more gradual steady increase in terms of activity, if that describes it. And Europe -- Europe was very similar to Canada, but might have even been a couple of weeks behind Canada as well.\nStephanie Benjamin -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nThank you. And then just on the ancillary services, can you just kind of walk us through where we stand now in the third quarter of having those services back online or -- and similarly, were there any services that you evaluated throughout this process and realized maybe it's not worth from either a margin or profitability standpoint to continue going forward? Just an update on where we see [Indecipherable] services would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So, Stephanie, I'll start and I'll let Eric weigh in here as well too. To answer your -- the last part of your question, no, all services were deemed necessary and an important part of our offering in that collection of assets, I talked about, and we did not stop using any of those services, nor did we plan to. When you're in a hot market, prices are strong, conversion rates are strong, and as we've talked about, oftentimes, -- and we saw this back in the recession in 2009, oftentimes, sellers do not stop and do some of the detailed reconditioning that they would do under normal circumstances. Now, some of our ancillary services continued to perform. Obviously, we were still doing inspections, we were still financing cars. We are still doing the transportation. Right? Those services were still intact and they were still operating and continue to operate and have done quite well. Some of the more on-site ancillary services, the paint and bodywork, some of the heavy paint bodywork, some of the reconditioning and mechanical work, some of that work didn't get done. And as a result, our revenues aren't back to what we would call near 100%. We're lagging a little bit there. And Eric, maybe you can speak a little bit more to that.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And I think the primary issue there is, if we are doing the work, it's taking longer because we have restrictions on how many people in an area. So -- and if it takes longer, the seller wants to get the cars sold so quickly, they're saying, OK, I'll go without that work being done right now, in the hot market that Jim mentioned. But we're able to do all the work, but we are probably taking a little longer to do some of that due to restrictions on proximity people can be to each other, how fastly we can process the vehicles. We would expect that to return to normal over time. And again if prices were to soften at any point in time, sellers would take -- would allow more time for us to get the work done and that number would start to come back. Even with that said, looking at the second quarter, ARPU, from our physical locations was quite strong. I mean, we were down 5% year-over-year. Most of that is related to April, because, remember, I'm giving you a quarterly number. It's not related to the average ticket we saw in May and June. It's mostly related to the shutdowns in April because we were still selling vehicles with no services available at all.\nStephanie Benjamin -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nNo, thanks, Eric, that's very helpful. And then lastly, you spoke a little bit specifically when it comes to capital allocation, just some additional digital transformation initiatives you have planned going forward. Could you highlight what some of those additional initiatives might be? Thanks.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, as I mentioned in my remarks, we pulled back a little bit on capital expenditures. Our number one capital expenditure is the technology investments we're making to continue advancing these platforms. You'll probably see us pick up on that in the second half of the year and especially going into '21. The other, though, is really nothing specific to talk about, but we are looking with an eye on, are there other businesses that would add to the offerings of KAR over time. And our partners Apax and Periphas are people that are helping us be focused on what do we need to add to the technologies to be the digital leader in a marketplace, in our case, the wholesale used car marketplace.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, and I think just to recap is, this year, it was strengthening the balance sheet, stabilizing the company, making all of the moves that we talked about in our commentary and continuing to drive this digital transformation in 2020. And at some point in time, we'll be coming to you with some ideas on what our capital allocation plan looks like as we go forward into 2021 and beyond. But other than that, right now, it's, let's take care of our -- let's take care of business at hand and let's continue to focus on this digital transformation for the balance of 2020.\nStephanie Benjamin -- SunTrust -- Analyst\nThanks so much.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nAnd thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Labick from CJS Securities. Your line is now open.\nBob Labick -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGood morning and thanks...\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Bob.\nBob Labick -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\n...for a lot of details. I wanted to follow up -- hi. I wanted to follow-up just on the ARPU discussions from a minute ago. I think you said most of your ARPU decline was April. So, was May and June back to normal levels? Is that how we're trending going forward? I'm just curious as to how ARPU was so strong, given the lack of ancillary services.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Bob, that's a good question. It's probably very close to year-over-year being comparable at physical -- the mix is changing, so remember, I'm giving you an ARPU from our physical locations and that would exclude the online-only portion of the business. So, the denominator and the numerator are really under the same basis and we're seeing it recover, slightly slower but much closer to normal. And I would tell you, I'm pretty sure that we have the ability, going forward, for that revenue per unit to continue growing even year-over-year, the high valued services. Probably the biggest pressure item is how quickly they are looking to sell the car because used car pricing is so strong, not the cost of services or the value proposition of the services. Speed is the name of the game for these sellers, especially the commercial sellers right now.\nBob Labick -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd that's always a good thing. That's always a good thing for our performance in all ways. High conversion rate will really lead to strong performance.\nBob Labick -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nAll right. And then, likewise, you gave us the trends throughout the quarter, which were quite dramatic. Was some of the volume recovery in June perhaps from unsold inventory from April and May? And how is like the overall market trending right now, given dealers are holding on a little bit more? Just trying to get a sense of how July looked if June was a kind of a catch-up from the lack of sales from closures earlier in the quarter or where your inventory stands now and where -- just as I said, like kind of the overall normalized level is not the super lower or snapback.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So your point is there were some back up in inventory as we go back to March, April. We had a lot of off-lease cars coming at us, that we're coming off-lease and they're vehicles that we're inventorying. You may -- in fact, you may have heard us talk about acquiring additional land. We weren't sure that we had enough capacity to handle the cars that were coming in. And quite frankly, as we started to sell cars week-over-week, we created capacity with the high conversion rate and as a result, we didn't have to acquire any additional land and we have no capacity constraints. And then we thought our volume was going to kind of hit record levels. And as we started selling week-over-week, our volume has actually been kind of at the low point.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, the inventory is down, Bob. And we can tell you what segment is causing it. It's repo. We had a lot of repos backed up in March and April. Those did work through and the repo activity has still been delayed in many states where there is moratoriums on repossessing vehicles. When that picks up, there is a backlog of repos to be processed, notwithstanding delinquency statistics that were talked about in an earlier question. And when those come in, I think, we feel the market is in a good spot, healthy. It is not overstocked like it was in April and early May. I'd say, we're back to more normal levels. And the one area where we're a little light right now would be repo inventory. And that would -- we think that's picking up here in the fall. We expect it.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd we have insights into that through our RDN platform, which shows us what the backlog of potential repossessions is and what normal activity is and they're just -- they're hung up at the finance companies right now waiting for execution.\nBob Labick -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nGot it, OK. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n[Indecipherable], Bob.\nOperator\nAnd thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Your line is now open.\nGary Prestopino -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, Jim and Eric.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Gary.\nGary Prestopino -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\nI had a couple of questions here. First of all, Eric, you said you got about $90 million of permanent cost reductions from eliminating some positions, but, overall, with what you've done in the pandemic, can you put a number on what the total cost reductions are across the company?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nGary, that's the number. That's the tangible number I'm going to give you because it's the headcount number and we've done other things, but at this point in time, I'm hesitant to quantify because some of it just could be temporary until we reopen. I don't know what the long term cost structure -- when I say reopen, start offering all of our services. We do, in addition to the $90 million, we probably have had several hundred employees who were on furlough who took other jobs and are not coming back. So that's going to be the 2000 names that remain on furlough. How much would that be? That will be tens of millions of dollars of additional cost that was not in that number. But I'm not giving you that until we know what the impact is as we get toward October when we decide how many come back and how many positions will ultimately be eliminated based upon the business performance at that time. But that's another 2000. The average salary on that compared to the $90 million might be -- it might be even more heavily weighted toward part-time. So it could be a little lower, but it would be a comparable relationship in my view.\nGary Prestopino -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\nOkay.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd then the non-labor headcount -- I'll as well say is, that's in the numbers in the -- if it's eliminated, it's in the numbers in the quarter and our other SG&A was down a little bit in other areas.\nGary Prestopino -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\nOkay. Then two more quick questions here. You said TradeRev, you're getting a 60% gross profit on the $350 ticket per car. What -- is that -- is TradeRev profitable in and of itself when you back out your sales and marketing expenses or does that gross profit include sales and marketing expenses?\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGross profit does not include sales and marketing, but our total performance. We were, as we said, above breakeven. We were just above breakeven in May and we were well above breakeven in June on an EBITDA basis. So positive EBITDA over that two-months period. And that's -- that by the way is quite an accomplishment. And that was driven by the fact that we were able to get 60% gross profit. Of the $350, about $270 is auction fees, the remainder is transportation revenue. And, as you know, that 60% includes the transportation revenue. That is outstanding performance.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nGary, as you can imagine, I've been waiting a long time to tell you that we're above breakeven on TradeRev.\nGary Prestopino -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\nYeah, yeah. We've been waiting too so. And then lastly, just a thought process here, given the fact that new vehicle sales look like they're going to be down fairly dramatically this year, are we kind of looking at maybe a mini-repeat of what happened in 2009 to 2011, where there was actually a pretty big impact to the supply of vehicles coming back to auction just because of that whole phenomenon with new car sales going down?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Gary, we maintain the position that we don't think there is a direct correlation between the SAAR and between used car sales. There's got to be a significant impact to the SAAR to really have an effect -- have a material effect on us. A couple of things that I would mention is, the number that we focused on as we focus on that vehicle churn, as you look at the car park, how many vehicles change hands on an annual basis, and that number has always been somewhere between the high-30 million, 38 million, 39 million to 45 million-ish. It's kind of been in that -- it's that vehicle turn that we focus on. There is no question that in -- with less supply, the dealers may hold on to more trade-ins and they may try to retail cars that they wouldn't normally try to retail. But if you think about it, I always use the example, if the SAAR dropped by 1 million, right, and 50% of those vehicles have a trade, that takes you down to 500,000, right, and the dealer keeps the cars that he wants to retail and we get 20% of that overall market, it becomes a rather small number. It doesn't have a material impact on us.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And Gary, if I could add, there is a big difference between what happened in '09 and what's happening in 2020. In '09 SAAR dropped to about 10 million and of that, retail SAAR dropped to about 7 million and fleet was a big supporter. In 2020, there is no fleet sales. We're going to be at a 13 million SAAR with almost all of the consumer purchases. So I will tell you, the reduced SAAR in 2020 is much more conducive to the used car marketplace than the reduced SAAR in 2009. So there is a difference. Lease penetration isn't down like it -- back in 2009. Lease penetration dropped to near 10% of all transactions on a lower number. We're seeing very high lease penetration. So I would tell you, this is a little bit healthier situation than the last recession where SAAR dropped.\nGary Prestopino -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you very much.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJustin, we wanted to let you know, we started a little late, we could probably take one or two more questions if they're in the queue.\nOperator\nUnderstood, sir. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBret Jordan -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, guys.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning, Bret.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nWhen you think about the profile of the auction bidder, obviously a lot of large public now used car stories out there needing inventory. Do you see the more volume going to the Carvana's or Vroom's of the world versus the small independent? And, I guess, if there is a market share shift to larger used dealers, where do you see the population of independent used car retail going?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, so as you mentioned those companies like Vroom and Carvana and CarMax and the like, listen, these are very good customers, they're very good buyers. They're our top buyers, in fact. But they also buy a very, what I would call, high-end vehicles; high-end vehicle with low miles, probably not much older than five years; and vehicles that can be reconditioned to very, very high standards. Whereas, you've got the independent dealer, at the other end of the scale, buying the lower-end car in many cases.\nIn fact, I would tell you that the real sweet spot right now for a lot of people is to buy that $5,000 and $6,000 car. If you think about it, people want private transportation. They don't want to be on public transportation, especially with this COVID thing going on. And that $5,000 or $6000 car has become a very popular car and that's kind of the car that the independent focuses on. So you're still kind of -- each dealer, kind of, has its market and focuses on that market and as we look across our dealer network, they're all doing well. And I think that they're all healthy now based on what's going on in the marketplace.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe've seen no reduction in the number of independent dealers' customers at AFC. In '09, we saw quite a reduction in the short term. They came back to the market fairly quickly. But we saw probably as many as 5,000 independent dealers bought a business in a very short period of time. We have not seen that in this cycle, Bret.\nBret Jordan -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks. And then one quick question. The changes in the dealer network in the U.K., that you noted, that drove the charge. What happened over there?\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, that was a very small business, Bret, that we invested in. And, quite frankly, the dealers weren't really, I would say, supporting a digital platform. They were more focused on brick and mortar auction. And as a result, it's really an accounting issue that Eric can speak to in terms of what we wrote down there. But from a -- from an opportunity standpoint, now, what we're seeing in the U.K. is we're seeing a number of sellers coming back to our people and saying, tell us more about your digital platforms and tell us more about what the opportunities are. So we think there is an opportunity in the U.K. and in Central Europe. In Europe, it's continued to -- as Eric said, we're at 75%, we'll be back to a 100% and maybe beyond by the end of the year. There is a huge opportunity there, especially with the COVID situation going on. We believe that we'll continue to sell more and more cars. But in the U.K., in a nutshell, I would say, it was just a resistance to technology.\nEric Loughmiller -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd specifically, Bret, what I'm referring to, there's been a -- the complete shutdown, it's a right hand drive, so the cars -- they don't have a market broader than the islands. And the number of dealers that are actively in business right now has declined and that was one of the major inputs into our analysis of the intangibles. So again, I don't think its long term but we wrote it off based upon the near term performance we expect in the U.K. with fewer dealers, fewer transactions in the short term.\nBret Jordan -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you.\nOperator\nAnd thank you. And now I would like to turn the call back over to CEO, Jim Hallett for closing remarks.\nJames P. Hallett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nGreat, thank you, Justin. And thank you ladies and gentlemen for being on our call today. We appreciate your continued support and your interest in our company. I'll just close by saying I've been in this business for over 40 years and throughout my entire career I've dealt with a lot of change and I've dealt with crisis throughout that period of time. And I really believe that, that experience over 40 years has really prepared me to deal with this COVID crisis. I can tell you, I think our team -- our management team was really well prepared. I was really pleased and really proud of the team and how quickly we acted and how courageously we acted in making our decisions and making our decisions early and making them quick and staying with them.\nI think we're now in a position where we've really rightsized the company. We're in a position to really grow the company through this digital transformation. We have adequate liquidity that we've talked about. We like the performance we're seeing on digital and the path forward. And for my last 10, 15 years, our investors have always asked Eric and I, \"do you see a day that some cars will all sell on digital channels or in a digital format?\" And I can tell you that we sold a 100% of our vehicles in a digital format in the second quarter of this year. So, someday is today and I believe that we have a value proposition here that will continue to more than satisfy our customers and be the choice going forward and that's the position and that's the focus that I have.\nSo as we go forward, we'll keep you up to date on how we're doing. But we're excited about what happened in the second quarter and more excited about what we're looking forward to here in the second half of the year. We're feeling pretty good about things. So thank you for being on. We appreciate it. And have a great day.\nOperator\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\nDuration: 66 minutes\nCall participants:\nMike Eliason -- Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations\nJames P.

Welcome to Enerpac Tool Group's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded March 24, 2021.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Bobbi Belstner, Director of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, Ms. Belstner.\nBobbi Belstner -- Director, Investor Relations & Strategy\nThank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Enerpac Tool Group's second quarter fiscal '21 earnings conference call. On the call today to present the company's results are Randy Baker, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Dillon, Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Schmaling, Chief Operating Officer.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.\nNow I will turn the call over to Randy.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Bobbi, and good morning everybody. We're going to start today on Slide 3. And before we review the details in the quarter, I'd like to provide an overview of Enerpac's progress and our recovery from the global pandemic. As always, safety is our number one concern for our employees worldwide. And as of today we still have approximately 40% working from home offices. In the quarter, we were affected by regional spikes in the infection resulting in full border closures in the Middle East. We responded by returning to the broad lockdown processes we've been using throughout the pandemic. Unfortunately this did have an impact on our sales and slowed our recovery progress. Despite these factors we were able to improve the performance in the quarter to near parity with our first quarter results. This is not our typical cycle within a fiscal year, as the second quarter is normally a low point for both sales and profit.\nSecondly, our cost efforts continue to support very positive decremental margins, which are in line with our expectations of 35% to 45%. As I discussed in prior quarters, we have protected our ability to execute the long-term strategy, including new product development, sales coverage and our capital allocation priorities. Our focus on the balance sheet as enabled us to pay down an additional $45 million in debt in the quarter, which further enhances the long-term performance of Enerpac. Lastly, as we emerge from the pandemic, Enerpac is focusing on developing and improving our company. We firmly believe without engaged well trained employees we cannot successfully execute our strategy. With that in mind, we have launched programs to recruit, develop and retain team members and ensure everyone is proud to be part of Enerpac.\nMoving over to Slide 4. Our weekly and monthly sales is our most monitored metrics we use to understand the progression toward full recovery. And consistent with prior quarters, this chart provides a graphical representation of our normal operating range and actual results experienced in the quarter. As you can see the second quarter was firmly back within the operating range of a normal year with the upward trend we expect. We believe this progress will continue through the balance of the fiscal year and position Enerpac at near normal levels as we progress through the third and fourth quarter.\nNow flipping over to Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, the second quarter was essentially flat with our first quarter results. Core sales declined by 11% in the quarter, comprised of down 11% in products and 12% in service. The increased infection rate experienced in the quarter resulted in border closures in several Middle Eastern countries which slowed our recovery. Absent these factors the topline would have been very close to achieving our prior year sales. Our adjusted EBITDA decremental margin was 29% or at the low end of our expected range. And year-to-date we have achieved a 21% decremental result. Our focus on cost controls continues to pay dividends and help protect our ability to execute the strategy. Free cash flow in the quarter was positive, which is not the typical result for our second quarter and on a year-to-date basis we have improved our free cash flow by more than $40 million year-over-year. This enabled Enerpac to pay down an additional $45 million in debt and exit the quarter with a leverage of 2.1 times.\nSales results vary by region, but were consistent with prior quarters. Europe and Asia Pacific have been our best performing regions in terms of consistency and progress toward normal sales volume. The Americas improved sequentially during the quarter, but are still in the mid-teens decline versus prior year. And as earlier mentioned, Mideast operations was affected by border closures which resulted in a decline year-over-year in the low double-digit range. Overall, we are progressing toward normal sales in operating ranges and delivering increasing profitability.\nI'm going to turn the call over to Jeff and Rick to review the details in the quarter and I'll come back with the market projections and some more guidance. Jeff, over to you.\nJeff Schmaling -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nThanks, Randy. I'll add some detail on Q2 from a regional perspective as well as touch on some of our key verticals and distribution and then I'll finish up on Enerpac operations and a few comments about the Cortland business. As a general comment, I think you'll see that this past quarter continues to confirm the significant differences and how our global markets are recovering as well as how the various countries and regions we serve are responding to the continued challenges of this pandemic.\nStarting on Slide 6. In total, we are pleased to see continued sequential year-over-year improvement in both product and service sales in the second quarter. Despite still being down year-over-year, we're encouraged by the feedback from our distributors about their businesses and the strong quoting activity that we're seeing in our primary markets. We'll start with the Americas. And as I said dealer sentiment has turned noticeably more positive and there is a general consensus that most will be getting back to pre-COVID activity levels in the coming months. We saw an increase in overall -- in stocking orders in both January and February and another decline in our drop ship rates which further confirms that our dealers confidence is improving. We're also seeing some positive indicators from our OEMs and national account business and we did see a sequential increase in our backlog for these accounts in the quarter, which is starting to look more like our normal pre-COVID levels.\nThe severe weather that caught Texans by surprise in February also contributed to some mis-product and service revenues around the Gulf. Some of these issues however, coupled with the strengthening or the continuing strength in oil prices may offer some opportunities to recover some of this as we move into the third quarter.\nLooking at our vertical markets. General construction and power gen, specifically wind continue to improve in the US as well as growing demand in mining in Western Canada in our oil sands customers. Strong copper and iron ore pricing and demand continues to give our mining distributors opportunities in Chile, Peru and Brazil. However, we are continuing to struggle a bit with COVID restrictions in Mexico. Our ability to visit customer sites and dealers is slowly improving and we're anxious to continue to ramp-up once the vaccination efforts and reopenings continue to get more traction.\nMoving on to Europe. Coming off a strong first quarter in Europe, we were up slightly year-over-year in the second quarter, but the region turned in a solid performance driven by both general distribution on core products as well as some nice project wins in Heavy Lifting and Machines. Various headwinds from continued COVID restrictions and some challenges related to Brexit did cause some minor delays in late quarter shipments, but we expect these to ease as the various countries sort through these new regulations. Taking a look at our key markets in Europe, we do continue to see strong quoting and wins in wind and infrastructure projects, especially in bridge construction and repair. Government spending in this sector is expected to remain robust and we are well positioned to capture more of this work in the back half, primarily in our Lifting and Torque and Tension products.\nI would normally not go into too much detail on this call about specific wins in the quarter, but I have included a picture here on the Dardanelles Bridge project near Istanbul to give you a glimpse of the kind of projects that gets us really excited. Enerpac supply of heavy cylinders, pumps and controls will enable the construction of what will be the longest suspension bridge in the world, connecting both sides of the Dardanelles strait. The bridge will carry three lanes of highway traffic in each direction and is slated to open in late 2023. While this project is not really material from the total company sales perspective, this project does show our strong capabilities with unique customer solutions to challenging problems, and is really a good example of the type of work that increase in infrastructure spending could bring in for us.\nMoving on to APAC. This region has faced multiple stops and starts as it relates to market recovery, due to the ongoing border lockdowns. China remains fairly stable and Australia, along with New Zealand are showing signs of improvement due to their quick response to infection flare-ups. Conversely, South East Asia continues to struggle and be a challenge, particularly in Malaysia and Thailand with lockdowns that just recently started to lift. I previously mentioned strong iron ore pricing and that's also driving some strength for us in mining in Australia. Investments in wind and power gen are providing some tailwinds as well for us as -- and oil prices are driving some improving sales and quoting on both products and services in this region.\nMoving on to Slide 7. And turning to our MENAC region. Overall, we did see sequential improvement for the quarter. We actually had a pretty strong quarter going until early February when as Randy mentioned, COVID spikes forced several border closings into some key areas of the Middle East. This did cause several projects to be suspended and pushed out some meaningful service and product revenue from our quarter. Despite the efforts of our team to utilize resources, we also saw a drop off of our quick turn work as well, which led to some unexpected underutilization. This as moved some projects to the right into the back half of the year and other projects completely out of the fiscal year. That being said, improved oil price and the continuation of OPEC's January production cuts may offer us some opportunities to supply crews at relatively short notice, so we're staying close to our customers to take advantage of any emergent work as it comes up.\nOn the product perspective in this region, we've been working hard and diversifying our exposure beyond oil and gas, and I'm really heartened by some success recently related to both product and service work in the Power Gen space as well as improved quoting and construction, rail and aero space. As we've progressed through the early part of Q3 here, we have begun to see some meaningful year-over-year improvement in our product order rates.\nSwitching from regions to new products, we like to talk about new products and Q2 was another strong quarter for new product development as we launched several products and maintained our NPVI metric at our 10% target for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our Q2 launch event included not only several marketing programs and collateral to get our customers and dealers engaged, but we're also continuing to increase the number of languages and translations that we can leverage common materials in more parts of the world to drive pre-orders and get our partners trained up on our new offerings.\nJust a couple of comments on our global operations. All of our sites continue to navigate the complexities of operating during a pandemic really well. Continuing to deliver on our commitments to safety, quality and on-time delivery, which were all positives for the quarter. As volume returns to a normalized level, we remain focused on utilization, which improved as we progressed through the quarter. On our earnings call back in December, we talked about the fact that we did not roll out of our typical September 1 price increases last year, but given the steady increase in both commodities and our freight costs, we will be taking pricing here in Q3 in all of our regions.\nSpeaking on our supply chain and inventory. As we enter the back half of the year, we're clearly expecting increased demand for our core products. And just as we did at the start of the pandemic, our supply chain and operations teams are working extremely hard to ensure our inventories match our outlook and we're staying ahead of lead times with our main suppliers to ensure we can continue to support our customers and win orders. In this tightening supply chain environment, we are again threading the needle a bit to make sure we have the right products on the shelves, but also that we don't burden the balance sheet with any excess inventory where it's not needed.\nAnd now switching to the Cortland business. We experienced another quarter of sequential improvement with the combined business down 21% year-over-year versus the 35% down we saw last quarter. I touched a little bit on the weather issues in Texas and that definitely impacted the industrial ropes portion of the Cortland business in the quarter. We are encouraged, however, by the increased port activity we're seeing now as a signal that overall activity is returning to a normalized level and we're seeing some nice opportunities in heavy lift for offshore renewables. I'm pleased to report that the COVID related production challenges we talked about in our last call have been resolved and we look forward to growth in the back half of this fiscal year.\nIn terms of the medical side of the business, we did see an increase in activity starting in January, as customers began to replenish their inventories and our relocation activities into our new Cortland, New York facility were completed. We expect the sales uptick in February to continue as we move into the second half and we're really excited about the future of the Med business and our efforts to continue to diversify our customer base that were bolstered by some nice wins this past quarter that put us into some new applications, new customers and leveraging our expertise.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rick for some financials.\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with a quick recap here on Slide 8. Fiscal 2021 second quarter sales increased slightly when compared to the first quarter and were down 11% from the prior year. Core tools product sales were down 10% and that's an improvement from down 14% in the first quarter. Service was down 12% compared to down 24% in the first quarter and Cortland sales were down 21% or $2 million versus down 35% in the first quarter. We had an approximately $3 million impact from our acquisition of HTL. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 10% and that's down from 12% reported in the first quarter and in the prior year. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 16%, which is up slightly from the prior year. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 25%.\nLet's turn to Slide 9. Jeff already covered what we're seeing by region, and I'll just make a few additional comments here. We had a favorable $3 million impact from foreign currency with the continued weakening of the dollar during the quarter. If current FX rates hold, we would expect to see continued tailwinds from currency in the back half of the year as well. As Jeff discussed, our service sales were impacted by border closing in our MENAC region. Those closings had an impact for the region of about $5 million and that includes $3 million from the delay of service project revenue in the quarter. It is important to note here that, but for the impact, we would have reported service revenues on parity with our 2020 results. This is a good indicator of recovery as the second quarter revenues in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '20 exclude the large projects that were included in '19. As a reminder, Q2 is historically our lowest quarter and Q3 is usually our strongest quarter. Q3 2020 was also the trough in terms of COVID impact on our results with core sales down 38% year-over-year. As we look at the pace of recovery going forward, we would expect to see accelerated sequential quarterly and year-over-year growth in the back half of the year as we anniversary our worst two COVID impacted quarters.\nSo moving on to adjusted EBITDA in the waterfall on Slide 10. As we have noted, our decremental margin excluding the impact of currency was 29% and continues to reflect the improved leverage that our lower cost structure provides as sequential volumes increase. We anticipate incremental margins in the back half will in turn be at the high end of our stated range of 35% to 45%. As we have seen through the pandemic, lower product sales volume continues to weigh heavily on our adjusted EBITDA margins. The impact of service sales was offset by a favorable mix with service margins up about 400 basis points year-over-year as we continue to focus on -- globally on higher volume at higher value-added and more profitable service work. Manufacturing variances, this quarter totaled approximately $1 million and that's down from the $6 million reported in Q1. It is comprised of three elements: service utilization, increased freight costs and under-absorption in our Cortland facilities on the lower sales volume that Jeff just discussed.\nWe have worked to stabilize our tools manufacturing facilities with minimal COVID disruptions in the quarter and as a result, you did not see the $3 million of under-absorption reflected in the first quarter. Our service under utilization is about $500,000 and that's down from the $2 million we saw in our first quarter, and consistent with our expectations on service coming into the quarter. As Jeff discussed, as we manage our service recovery through the pandemic, we have been closely monitoring projects and timing of our labor mobilization, which has allowed us to right-size our permanent and temporary labor resources for existing demand.\nOur second quarter air freight spend was about $1 million. This is up from the $800,000 we incurred in the first quarter on both volume and rates. With our increasing demand, we had more air freight in the quarter. Air freight rates remain at 2 times normal levels and we expect this to continue through our fiscal year-end. We continue to see rising commodity costs in particularly steel and aluminum and with rising demand suppliers are now seeking price increases. We expect to see a 2% to 3% increase in steel machine parts or $200,000 to $600,000 increase in costs. Although aluminum prices have increased approximately 60% since the beginning of our fiscal year, we have negotiated aluminum driven cost increases in the 3% to 6% range with our suppliers, which will limit the impact on our spend in the back half of the year.\nAs Jeff noted, we are moving ahead with targeted pricing actions in all regions that will pass through these inflationary costs. As we discussed last quarter, we are winding down our temporary COVID cost actions with savings of approximately $1 million in the quarter and that split evenly between international government stimulus funds and remaining international furloughs. SG&A favorability includes both reduced travel costs and outside consulting. We expect travel cost to continue to fluctuate as sales and commercial activities expands or retracts by region. EBITDA margins also reflect that we reinstated our bonus plan and COVID [Phonetic] can match this quarter. The combined impact resulted in an increase of about $3 million in expense year-over-year. While the bonus impact is oversize in terms of historical expense at this level of EBITDA, it is important for us to recognize the tremendous commitment of our employees during the crisis. Our previously announced restructuring actions resulted in approximately $3 million in the savings -- in savings for the second quarter.\nTurning now to liquidity on Slide 11. We generated just over $1 million in free cash flow during the quarter, and this was the first time we generated free cash flow in our second quarter in over five years. A $4 million increase due to timing in receivables was offset by an increase in payables. We were able to hold inventories flat, striking a balance between increasing demand and working capital management. As we look to the back half of the year, we will continue to monitor inventory levels, but do anticipate increased levels in the third quarter in conjunction with the increasing demand. We ended the quarter with $115 million in cash on hand and that's after paying down $45 million of our borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. Our leverage is at 2.1 times and that's up from the 1.9 times at the end of the first quarter.\nWe are pleased with where we sit from a cash and liquidity perspective. As we progress through the back half of the year, our leverage should improve significantly as we drop off our worst two COVID impacted quarters from our trailing 12-month EBITDA. This should position us well as we look to continue our strategy execution and disciplined capital allocation.\nRandy. I'll turn it back over to you now.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Rick. Let's turn over to Slide 12. As we think about the balance of the year in our progress toward normal sales volumes and profitability, we've come to the conclusion the full economics and the sequential improvement will position Enerpac at near parity with our 2019 core sales levels as we exit the fiscal year. Secondly, we fully expect incremental margins to be in the range of 35% to 45% on core sales, and lastly, we will continue to focus on cost control and executing our margin expansion strategy. All the current economic outlooks are pointing toward full recovery as we exit the fiscal year and support our forward projections. This is further supported by our booked orders, which have increased sequentially and are up 15% in the first few weeks of March. As always, we are cautious concerning the potential resurgence of the virus, however, the advent of a wide distribution of vaccines is creating our sense of optimism.\nMoving over to Slide 13. This brings us to our projections for the remainder of fiscal 2021. We are projecting sales to be in the range of $280 million to $290 million with accelerating sequential improvement. We are projecting the growth rates in the back half of the year as follows: products should be up in the mid 20% range, services project to be up in the low-to-high 40% range and Cortland is projected to improve by 20% to low 30%. Additionally, incremental margin should be at the high end of our normal range of 35% to 45% benefiting from cost actions and the high gross profit generated from tool sales. Our assumptions remain consistent with our objectives to reduce the interest expenses and maximize earnings.\nAs with many companies the road to recovery has been long, but our team has performed extraordinarily well under very difficult conditions. We have proven the strength and vitality of the Enerpac Tool Group and to remain profitable even under the most difficult conditions. Enerpac remains an industrial leader in high-precision and quality tool with best-in-class operating results. And as you can see from our final slide the four basic strategic objectives remain consistent and we are highly committed to their achievement.\nOperator, with that, that concludes today's prepared remarks. Let's open it up for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Please state your question.\nJoe Grabowski -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nYes, good morning everyone. It's Joe Grabowski on for Mig, this morning.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nJoe Grabowski -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for the guidance. Very helpful and a lot of color around it too. It's difficult looking at year-over-year right now because we're about to go against the toughest of COVID shut down. So I was looking at your guidance, second half '21 versus first half '21, and at the midpoint it implies a 19% improvement, second half versus first half. The chart on Slide 4 show that there is seasonality and sales to improve in a normal year from second half to first half, maybe 5% or 6%. But when you think about your business as your end markets geography, second half versus first half, what are kind of the key drivers for that 19% sequential second half improvement?\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me cover the broad side and then Jeff, why don't you jump in on some specifics. But if you think about the percentage that I discussed of the back half growth rates of tool sales in the broad vertical markets we serve are key to our profitability because that's where the highest gross profit comes from and then certainly the full recovery of our service business, which includes the service rental. So we're looking at all our major vertical markets as Jeff mentioned we're seeing great activity in civil construction, which includes bridge activity, bridge maintenance. We're seeing good activity in alternative energy markets. And we also see a very strong commodity market. And if you go backwards in time and think about when were the last times we saw commodity prices at this level? Not specifically, the oil and gas markets, which are certainly trending very well in the right direction. But if you also think about the base metals and agricultural products, it's all pointing in the right direction. So that's probably one of the macro drivers that I look at or the fundamental supporting those growth rates and we feel they are and so that's the drivers there. And then Jeff, do you want to jump in and give some more specific?\nJeff Schmaling -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nYes, kind of leapfrogging on to your commodity story. Normally as we enter Q3, we're starting to see a ramp-up in construction especially infrastructure type work. So that -- that's a normal sequential thing for us, but we're seeing increased activity after frankly kind of a quiet period we've been through during -- due to the pandemic. And a lot of our OEMs that service a variety of verticals are seeing increased activity as I spoke to in my comments as well. So infrastructure especially and as I highlighted the bridge project, but there is an awful lot of those in our quote log as well. We're starting to see some improvement in that type of spending here in the US, although not nearly enough quite yet. We're looking forward to some of that. But overall, just an uptick in kind of all the prime verticals that we serve.\nJoe Grabowski -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nGreat. Okay. That's really helpful color. Thank you. And I guess my follow-up question. I'll kind of stick with the same math. If I look at EBITDA second half versus first half, rough math, it implies about a 17% EBITDA margin in the second half versus an 11% on the first half. So pretty healthy incremental sequentially. Maybe just talk about some of the cost headwinds and the cost tailwind that are may be helping or hurting second half to first half to drive that EBITDA margin improvement?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. I think the -- as we've been saying I think the biggest tailwind will be improving product volume. And so that's going to be the biggest driver to that improvement first half to second half. You'll see about the -- see incremental bonus expense at some level. And you'll see a little bit of incremental savings. We hope to get the benefit of continued improved utilization less under absorption like you saw in Q2. So I think the biggest -- Q1 to Q2 I think the biggest tailwind will be product volume. You do have a mix play that will be favorable as the product volume kicks out and that's going to be our biggest driver of improvement.\nJoe Grabowski -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst\nGot it, OK. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Good luck.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey, good morning guys.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Jeff.\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nSo just on -- I guess another cut it price cost, I think you talked about air freight manufacturing variances in the first half. How are you thinking about manufacturing variances in the second half? And then also, are you doing something to kind of shift away from this air freight issue over time?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo a couple of things. I think air freight is a bigger factor now because of the rising demand and it's not just our business, it's kind of global and our -- managing our inventory levels. So as I said on the call, you saw more in Q2. As we carefully balance inventory levels, you'll see a little bit more air freight than normal. I think over time, you see -- as we've talked about, the goal is to minimize air freight and we focus a lot on our sales and us planning to do that. This is an unusual period because we are kind of threading the needle here on how much inventory you let back in without just opening the floodgates until we see kind of a sustainable level of normal demand that Randy talked about which we think we'll get to by the end of the quarter.\nI think from a utilization and a cost perspective or absorption, we still believe back half will have neutral to favorable absorption as we look at our operating facilities, certainly favorable front half to back half, and then the cost associated with that as we talked about, we took the targeted pricing such that any incremental commodity flash rate, all of those inflationary costs would be covered by pricing, so that should be a net neutral from an EBITDA perspective.\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. And then just at a high level, I mean, I think you seem to have line of sight to kind of get back to demand levels kind of pre-COVID. And for dating [Phonetic] that you were -- there are a lot of moving pieces with kind of restructuring and resizing the company for its simplification. Just maybe as you step back and look at the -- your structural cost base, how are you feeling about as you get back to this more normal rate kind of starting to get back on track to these long-term margin targets?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. As we consistently talked about structurally, we've taken the $32 million worth of cost out. We feel good about that. There will always be opportunities to continue to drive efficiency and we continue to look at that. We really think from a margin perspective, this is really about volume. And then I define it in two steps. First, getting back to kind of that normal flow which would take us back to when we set the margin target, take us back to that $600 million in topline, and then -- and we view that as market recovery. And then leveraging our growth on top of that, which is driven by NPD, which is driven by focus on value-added and service work and rental, we believe those two as kind of the final steps to getting to that 25%. If the recovery continues, the sooner we get to the $600 million mark, you've got margins in excess of 20% that based on the work we've done, it should be in that 21% to 22% if not better. And then the further sequential improvement of value is what drives us to a 25%. So we are still committed to our objective. We think we've done all of the things we need to do and a little bit of broken record. You see it in the quarter, we see it in the EBITDA margin improvements, first half, back half. We believe getting back to that normal run rate gets us to the 20% plus EBITDA margin and sets us up to drive 25%.\nJeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Brendan Popson with CJS Securities. Please state your question.\nBrendan Popson -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask with your commentary on the back half of the year. Obviously, Q3 is typically the strongest, but it sounds like you're expecting the recovery -- sequential growth in the Q4. I just want to confirm if that's the case. And then following up on that, you also had a comment that you expect to be at pre-COVID levels at the exit of the year. So I guess outside of any further hiccups, is that looking out beyond FY '21? Is that a good way to think about your revenue potential as we exit the year?\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, that's exactly what we were referring is that first of all, the sequential improvement will accelerate. And we're very happy with the inbound orders that we've seen to date in March. And one of the interesting elements that we're watching is that if you recall last year, the big drop-off didn't occur until the last week or so of March. And so the fact that we were already 15% up versus prior year in March is really supporting our projections that it's going to accelerate and we're going to have somewhat of an off-cycle or a typical year, where the third quarter is our peak, followed by the fourth. We believe that that will be -- that cycle will not occur this year that will be sequentially better each month and each quarter.\nAnd so if you think about the pressure wave that I gave you in the slides earlier on in our prepared remarks, that gives you the range of a normal operating year. And what we do is we look at the best months that have been achieved and the worst month have achieved over a particular history of the company, and you can see we're back in that range, and the slope of that line has been accelerating. So we look at the economic reports. We look at our inbound booked orders. We're looking at how well our factories are performing. And then we look at our major vertical markets that Jeff walked us through, and all of those factors bring us to the conclusion that the exit point of the year we're back in business. And as Rick said, now that we've worked on our balance sheet, very, very hard, we positioned this company very well to start accelerating our strategies, which is around certainly other things beyond just the organic growth story.\nBrendan Popson -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJust to add...\nBrendan Popson -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nYes, go ahead.\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nQuickly here, when you look at the pressure wave on Slide 4 in terms of how you should be thinking about Q3 versus Q4. Q3 obviously, normally has that peak, you can see it on the pressure wave. This will be a sequential improvement, and if you look at that dotted line, it speaks clearly to order rates getting back to kind of normal by the time you get to the end of our Q4. So by normal, we mean back into the pressure wave, and that's our expectation. So your question of the continued sequential improvement, as Randy described, you can also see it on the slide.\nBrendan Popson -- CJS Securities -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Thank you. I appreciate the color.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nAnn Duignan -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. I'd like to just go back to price cost if we could. Can you talk about the pricing that you said you've issued this quarter? Is that just on products going through distribution? Is that on all products? Is it on all products and services? And how much did you increase pricing? I'm trying to get a sense of how much pricing will contribute to the guidance you gave for decrementals -- incrementals?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo I view this as similar to what we did back when we were looking at tariffs. These were targeted pricing for targeted products that are specifically impacted by the costs we're seeing. So it wasn't across the board. As we talked that the tariffs, it's anywhere from, call it, 1% to as high as 4%. But again it's specific to the cost impacting those products. So when you think about read through pricing on a net basis, what I said earlier was this will -- pricing will offset cost. And we'll continue to look here in the back half do we -- what pricing looks like going forward to generate that normal lead to roughly 1% that we would take on an annual basis. But these actions are cost specific and net neutral for the back half of the year.\nAnn Duignan -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nAnd I appreciate that. I guess my follow-up is along the same lines. On the cost side then, I'm assuming now that you had purchased a lot of your steel and a lot of your aluminum earlier before prices got to where they are today. So you may be price cost-neutral for the next quarter or two quarters based on your forecast. But for how long will the current pricing cover you in terms of neutral into next year without further price increases?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, what's a little bit different this year than maybe historically is while we do have some of the steel or machine parts, I should say purchased, we're not sitting nearly anywhere near the inventory levels that we've historically had. So the numbers I gave are kind of back half focus with the price really being taken to offset those costs. So at some point, should prices go down or when prices go down, there will be a benefit. But right now, we're really factoring in how we're going to manage this, the cost associated with bringing inventories back up, both to meet demand and then on a go-forward basis, we've been talking about sales and also [Phonetic] planning. So our purchases will be much closer to demand than we've historically seen and we should see the lower inventory levels accordingly.\nAnn Duignan -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nOkay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up on cash flow. Would you expect cash flow to be negative in Q3, just given comments and adding inventory, etc, just unseasonably but the first half was unseasonable also?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nRight. We didn't provide the guide on cash. And I think you hit it because we really have to monitor inventory enough to monitor demand and the timing of the demand through Q3, Q4. As we talked about earlier, you definitely see an accelerating demand as we approach the end of Q4. So this is about working capital, which will be the biggest driver, obviously, when it gets lots of favorability from the EBITDA. But the working capital is going to be carefully managed. So it's hard to say, what those data look like on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nAnn Duignan -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nOkay, I appreciate that. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Please state your question.\nDeane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nDeane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHey, could we circle back on the impact of the extreme weather in Texas? You said there were some miss business opportunities, interruptions. Can you quantify that? How much was regrouped in the quarter? How much you think in the coming quarter that will contribute in terms of a catch-up? And are there any new construction opportunities that will come out of it? We're hearing lots of investment in hardening of the grid and the wind turbines, any new opportunities that are going to come out of that for you guys?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. I'll start with impact on the quarter that -- from a quarter perspective, I would say, roughly call it $1 million topline, somewhere in there. So -- and it's just definitely a split between Q2, Q3, Q4 -- likely Q3. So not a huge impact but an impact nonetheless as the margin flow through on those products, on that work is pretty good. So that's what we see in terms of impact. Timing, it is a split between Q2, Q3. And we did start to see that will come back online as we kind of navigate it through the quarter. So that's how we think about the impact from the weather in Texas. Jeff, do you want to talk about opportunities?\nJeff Schmaling -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nYes. Again, just -- mainly what was impacted was some labor -- some jobs that we were scheduled to go out and we didn't. Primarily the biggest from a margin impact was the lack of rentals. We normally rent quite a bit of tooling out of our Deer Park facility, which obviously didn't go out, had a little bit of logistics impact. We couldn't get trucks in and out, where we needed to ship some products. But I guess the impact on product was relatively minor. In terms of going forward, yes, I think a lot of it is going to come back perhaps plus some in Q3. Here, we're already seeing our rentals start to pick up. Our request for a little longer term rental on equipment pick up. And to your question specifically, we are seeing some opportunities for some repair and some strengthening of the grid down there. So probably -- primarily a Q3 impact on the plus side.\nDeane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAll right. That's good to hear. And I apologize if you said this and I missed it. The uptick in orders for March of 15% is pretty impressive. And any way you would break that out in terms of geographies, business verticals, just additional color there? I think since that is we're at this pivot point now, anything that we can gauge, that would be helpful.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me just start off so it's very broad. It's what we needed to see and a lot of good regional improvement. And Jeff, do you want to jump in there?\nJeff Schmaling -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nYes, I mean that's the highlight of that one. It's across a lot of verticals. It's across a lot of regions, and it includes orders from distribution. So the fact that we can't pinpoint one big contributor overall is a good news for me, that it is a little more widespread positive uptick.\nDeane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd does that also includes geographies?\nJeff Schmaling -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nYes, absolutely.\nDeane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat.\nJeff Schmaling -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nYes.\nDeane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay, that's good to see. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJeff Schmaling -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nThanks, Deane.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nMichael McGinn -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, everybody.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nMichael McGinn -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nJust want to start -- good morning. I just want to start off by saying as a native Central New Yorker, it's not every day you hear about incremental manufacturing investment into Cortland New York, so appreciate that. My first question relates to the long-term growth algorithm you guys have stated with leverage now in a reasonable place. Historically, your focus on M&A has been addressing different geographies within tooling like the Larzep brand. Going forward, do you still think there is room for regional geographic expansion? Or is this a different model where maybe you're looking to get closer to the factory floor with tooling in our nation? Or anything that stands out for you guys right now?\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, let me just try to recap some of the things we've talked about in the past and then bring it back to your question about geographies. The main thing that we focused on has been the verticals and then the associated tools that go with those vertical markets. So things that have been highly interesting to us in our last acquisition, which is essentially just a year ago, that was based in the torque and tension markets, which we thought was a great fit to expand our tool platforms and we've already seen the benefits of that acquisition of expanding our torque wrench product lines. We still -- we now have a full three-tier product line. And I believe that that has been a very good acquisition. So that's a good example of how we view it, both from a vertical market we intend to participate more in and then the types of tools that go into that vertical market.\nAnd so things for us right now, obviously, torque tension handle and transferring devices are still very interesting. Cutting and bending devices are also very interesting. And then the peripheral tools that are in general industrial markets like aerospace are also quite interesting. And then to directly answer your question relative to the geography. As we've said in the past, we believe a brand in the Asia-Pacific market at some point would be very valuable. And that's really the last major geographic move we need to make would be an Asia Pacific manufactured brand.\nMichael McGinn -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nGreat. I appreciate it. And then moving on to the margins. I know a lot has been discussed already. But if I back into the numbers, I'm coming up with something like the -- you're probably going to have to breach that 20% operating margin threshold within IGS by the fourth quarter. I just want to make sure I have that correct. Is that on par with similar prior peaks? And maybe can you help us frame what the margin differential from your new product development efforts have been under the 80-20 simplification versus SKUs that you kind of -- you just have been rolling off the platform in terms of legacy products that are maybe lower margin that you've offered previously?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI think from a margin perspective relative to Q3, Q4 progression, I think we are saying, when we end the Q4, we'll have an order rate that supports a 20% -- at least 20% margin run rate going forward. So that's how we're describing our progression through the back half of the year. If you -- Jeff, do you want talk about NPD and margins there?\nJeff Schmaling -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\nYes, I mean, certainly, as we develop new products, our target is always to be at least debt line average and hopefully, a little bit above if they're really new and innovative products. So I don't see any interruption in that as we continue to launch new products. So certainly, the intent is for all those to be incremental.\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd with any NPD that they don't always start at target, but we've had success in getting them fairly quickly.\nMichael McGinn -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nOkay. And then if I could sneak one more in on a more specific end market. Rail has come up a couple of times as an incremental opportunity. I just want to see, is this something where you're in the railcar manufacturing facilities on the track? Are you working in conjunction with like Nordco Wabtec application? Or can you just kind of frame what your rail business is and what it looks likes and who you compete within that market?\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Sure, most of our activity is really on the rail side and the maintenance side of that system. We've got several specifically designed products to help maintain and install new rail and things like that. The competitors in that space kind of are normal hydraulic competitors. We have several partners that are primary suppliers to the big rail operators. So it is through distribution, but it's relatively targeted specific distributors that sell to those end users. So that's a space that we are bringing out some new products and some updates to our current product line. But given the age of that infrastructure, we do think there is opportunity there. And already this year, we've seen a fairly nice uptick in orders into that space.\nMichael McGinn -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\nGot it. Appreciate the time.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Mike.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with G. Research. Please state your question.\nJustin Bergner -- G. Research -- Analyst\nGood morning, Randy. Good morning, Rick, and rest of the team.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nJustin Bergner -- G. Research -- Analyst\nJust to start, I want to sort of step back and look at that 20% EBITDA margin guidance. You know, if you end the current fiscal year with something on the order of $525 million of revenue and $70 million to $75 million of adjusted EBITDA, what are the benefits beyond the normal incrementals that allow you to get to that 20% margin at $600 million of revenue, which basically would translate to an incremental $45 million to $50 million of EBITDA on an incremental $70 million of revenue? I'm just having sort of some difficulty thinking of the drivers beyond the sort of normal incremental range that allows you to get there?\nRick Dillon -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. And when we say, get into that normal and that $575 million to call it $600 million in revenue, we look at that. If you go -- coming out of '19, we were guiding, call it, somewhere between five -- I think the midpoint is right around $595 million of that original guide. We've now taken all of the cost -- $33 million of the costs -- or of cost out that exiting at that $600 million level with -- combined with the leverage on the cost out, that gets you to that 35% to 45% incremental, definitely high end, and it also results in the EBITDA margin at a normal run rate at $600 million plus revenues, that EBITDA margin to be above 20%. So in terms of what happens, it's really product growth and product volume, that's what's really missing right now. And when I say product, it also includes -- Jeff talked about this earlier, improved rental service activity as part of our value-add move. And then you get the approved -- sorry, improved manufacturing utilization from the volume and we do have continued facility rationalization benefits that are yet to come as well. So all those combined, consistent with our original margin walk, we think you hit that roughly $600 million mark. You've done -- we've done all the self-help things up to that point to get us to 20% and plus $600 million above 20%. And that above 20% to 25% is really driven off of market NPD value-added work and continuing to drive efficiencies within our manufacturing facilities.\nJustin Bergner -- G. Research -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you. My second question relates to the infrastructure demand in Europe. I think this is something that you've emphasized new today or at least emphasized a lot more today. So what are the drivers there? Obviously, Europe is a lot of different countries and subregions. Does this have legs? How much of your European revenue base is tied up with infrastructure related demand at present? Just any sort of background you can provide will be helpful.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. There has been a book of quotes that we have had for numerous projects. I emphasize the bridge project especially, we've got numerous bridge projects, numerous -- just kind of transportation related quotes that we've had open quotes on for months. And it's been really encouraging that we are seeing many of those start to come to award stage. So I think, as I talk to my team in Europe, they are pretty bullish on the fact that the spending that has been planned for since pre-COVID is starting to get released. So I hesitate to give you a percentage of our revenue over there that's tied up in that. But between those projects and the sales going through our general distribution, it's a meaningful amount of our business. So I think it's -- there is some pent-up demand there, but there has also been some new projects as well that we're starting to get some information on. So good news frankly, all around.\nJustin Bergner -- G. Research -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. That's all the questions today. I'll now turn it back to management for closing remarks. Thank you.\nRandy Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAll right.

{"date":"Jun 9, 2021, 8:30 a.m. ET","exchange":"NYSE: ABM","q":"2021-Q2","ticker":"ABM","transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nGreetings and welcome to the ABM Industries' Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. David Gold, Investor Relations for ABM Industries. Thank you. You may begin.\nDavid Gold -- Investor Relations\nThank you for joining us this morning. With us today are Scott Salmirs, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Earl Ellis our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued our press release yesterday afternoon announcing our second quarter fiscal 2021 financial results. A copy of this release and the accompanying slide presentation can be found on our corporate website.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that our call and presentation today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. Our use of the words estimate, expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify these statements. Statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds.\nWhile we believe them to be reasonable, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These factors are described in a slide that accompanies our presentation as well as our filings with the SEC.\nDuring the course of this call, certain non-GAAP financial information will be presented. A reconciliation of those numbers to GAAP financial measures is available at the end of the presentation and on the Company's website under the Investor tab.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, David. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. As detailed in yesterday's press release, ABM reported strong second quarter financial results, building on the progress we achieved in our first quarter.\nSecond quarter adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share increased to $0.82, up nearly 37% from the year ago quarter. We generated significant operating leverage with adjusted EBITDA improving 17% year-over-year to $106.6 million and adjusted EBITDA margin increasing 100 basis points to 7.1% on slightly higher revenues.\nWe are pleased to note that for the first time in five quarters, growth in four of our key segments, B&I, T&M, Education and Technical Solutions more than offset the softness in Aviation which, while improved on a sequential basis, continue to reflect the impact of the pandemic.\nIn short, our second quarter performance reflected a consistently high level of operational execution by our team amid gradually improving business conditions, in sync with the reopening of the economy. This strong showing and our current visibility have enabled us to increase our full-year guidance for adjusted earnings per share, while we continue to invest to support future growth.\nConsistent with what we have discussed over the past several quarters, our customers continue to prioritize protecting their people and spaces, driving strong demand for our higher-margin virus disinfection work orders. EnhancedClean, our proprietary and trusted protocols for cleaning and disinfecting spaces was an important contributor to our second quarter results as well.\nWe also continue to benefit from efficient labor management as our flexible labor model enabled us to identify and capitalize on staffing efficiencies arising from the adoption of remote and hybrid work environments, particularly within our B&I segment where office occupancy in large metropolitan areas remain relatively low. As employees transition back to the office, we anticipate some easing in our labor efficiency, but we expect revenue growth in the second half of the year and increased work orders to mitigate that effect.\nWith our scale, capabilities, end market diversity and breadth of services, ABM remains well positioned for continued revenue and earnings growth as the reopening momentum continues. There are several key trends that support our outlook for continued strong performance in the coming quarters.\nFirst, our clients in both the office and manufacturing markets indicate they plan to continue to incorporate disinfection into their cleaning protocols as they prepare for the return of staff and workers to their offices and industrial facilities.\nIn fact, given the heightened concerns around pandemic risks and greater awareness of public health issues in general, we expect these specialized services to remain in demand and to become part of our client contracts. ABM has been an essential partner in helping our customers navigate through the challenges of the past year and our 90%-plus retention rate, which ticked up in the second quarter speaks to the confidence our customers have in our services and capabilities.\nSecond, we expect continued sequential improvement in our Aviation segment, as pent-up demand for travel translates into higher demand for aviation services. As Earl will discuss in his comments, we are transitioning our Aviation business mix to favor higher-margin contracts with airports and adjacent facilities, with less of a focus on airline services. This strategic shift has created attractive growth opportunities for ABM outside of the airport, such as parking services and provides for a more consistent and more profitable business mix in our Aviation segment.\nAdditionally, we expect to see increased demand for disinfection and cleaning services in line with the pickup in travel activity. Early signs of return to leisure travel have been encouraging and increased business travel is projected to follow later in the year and into next year.\nThird, school districts have accelerated the return to in-person learning. Our conversations with school district professionals and educational institutions indicate that with the full-time return to school expected this fall, cleaning and disinfecting will be a priority throughout the school year. We expect these services to become part of the broader scope of services for new contracts and rebids, providing ABM with revenue and growth opportunities.\nFinally, the energy efficiency and retrofit solutions that we offer in our Technical Services segment, our highest margin business, provide significant operating cost savings for our customers and enable them to reduce their environmental impact. Now that we have greater access to client sites, we expect to increasingly work through our Technical Services backlog, which was at a record level at the end of the second quarter. Additionally, this segment is well positioned to benefit from the new administration's priorities around decarbonization and energy efficiency.\nAs we look toward the second half of the fiscal year, we are confident that we can leverage our significant competitive advantages to achieve continued progress. You may recall that at the very outset of the pandemic, we established 19 operational task forces or pods as we call them, to marshal our tremendous internal resources on the issues at hand, to focus on our virus disinfection offerings; our field operations; as well as finance, legal, liquidity, cash flow and human resources.\nThis task force model proved to be a fast and effective way of identifying potential business issues and utilizing cross-functional expertise to develop and implement solutions. Given the success of these initiatives, we will continue to use this model to address emerging situations. In fact, our human resources task force is now focused on recruiting and retention and will be instrumental in helping us manage utilization as additional staffing is required to accommodate increased occupancy levels.\nAdditionally, our strong balance sheet and robust cash flow provide us with substantial resources to fund investments to support future growth. We invested in information technology initiatives during the first half of fiscal 2021 and we anticipate investing further during the second half of the year. These investments in technology, data analytics and strategic initiatives are designed to strengthen our client relationships and further empower our employees.\nWhile we will speak about these initiatives later in the year, I can share that we are currently piloting client-facing solutions using sensors to generate real-time occupancy data that inform our janitorial programs and allow us to share service delivery details with our clients via digital displays.\nAdditionally, we are expanding our use of technology to workforce management with a digital test management solution that records work performed and facilitates dynamic route changes to accommodate shifting client demand.\nLastly, the ABM brand is recognized worldwide, and our recent advertising campaign has served to reinforce the scale, scope and capabilities of our organization. These attributes enabled us to step in immediately to provide our branded services to clients needing a safe environment for their employees and consumers.\nThe ABM brand is synonymous with this tremendous commitment to customer service, which is supported by our ability to deliver. As we enter a post-pandemic environment, we believe the ABM brand will provide us with considerable competitive advantages across our business segments.\nTurning now to the specifics of our outlook. Given our strong performance in the first half and our expectations for continued year-over-year growth in the second half, we are maintaining our guidance for full-year fiscal 2021 GAAP income from continuing operations of $2.85 to $3.10 per diluted share, inclusive of a second quarter litigation reserve of $0.32.\nAt the same time, we are increasing our guidance for full-year 2021 adjusted income from continuing operations to $3.30 to $3.50 per diluted share, up from $3.00 to $3.25 previously. This includes additional investments in client-facing technology and workforce management. We're also increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin to a range of 7% to 7.3% from 6.6% to 7% previously.\nWe also ended the first half with robust new sales of $727 million, including $100 million associated with our EnhancedClean offerings, another first half record. This supports our confidence in the Company's organic second half performance. Additionally, we continue to explore acquisition opportunities where, as a strategic buyer, we would be able to drive meaningful revenue and operating synergies.\nBefore I turn the call over to Earl, I'd like to thank all of our ABM team members for their continued dedication and hard work. Over the past year, we have made tremendous operational progress and have proven our value as an essential partner to our clients during these dynamic and challenging times.\nI've never been more inspired by our purpose, our team and our organization. I also want to thank our customers for their confidence in us. As we emerge from this difficult period, I am so pleased with our performance and are more confident than ever in our future potential.\nI'll now turn the call over to Earl.\nEarl Ellis -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 0.1% from last year. As Scott mentioned, revenue in four of our segments grew on a year-over-year basis, offsetting the continued pandemic-related softness we've experienced in the Aviation segment. Key revenue growth drivers in the quarter included higher disinfection related work orders and continued strong demand for our EnhancedClean services.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $31.1 million or $0.46 per diluted share. By comparison, in last year's second quarter, we reported GAAP income from continuing operations of negative $136.8 million or negative $2.05 per diluted share.\nAs Scott mentioned, GAAP income from continuing operations in this year's second quarter includes a non-cash $30 million reserve for an ongoing litigation equivalent to $0.32 per diluted share. This non-cash reserve relates to litigation dating back 15 years, primarily relating to a legacy timekeeping system that was phased out in full by 2013. You will find additional information in our Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today.\nThe recorded reserve is based on a host of factors, considerations and judgments and the ultimate resolution of this matter could be significantly different. As this litigation remains ongoing, we are unable to disclose further information at this time.\nAs a reminder, last year's GAAP loss included a $2.55 per share impairment charge. Excluding these charges, our adjusted income from continuing operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was $55.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $40.4 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.\nThe increase in adjusted income from continuing operations was attributable to our strong operational performance, including growth in our higher margin services as well as efficient labor management and the recapture of bad debt.\nIn addition, we benefited from favorable business mix, particularly in our Technical Solutions segment where we executed on higher-margin projects. Excluding items impacting comparability, corporate expense for the second quarter increased by $26.6 million year-over-year. Approximately $10 million of the variation was due to increased stock-based compensation, with the remaining $16 million representing investments and other-related expenses. Thus, information technology and other strategic investments spend in the first half of fiscal 2021 was $20 million, in line with our expectations.\nNow, turning to our segment results. Business & Industry revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year to $796.2 million, driven largely by strength in demand for higher-margin disinfection related work orders and EnhancedClean services. As a result, operating profit in this segment increased 44.1% to $85.3 million.\nOur Technology & Manufacturing segment continue to see upside from demand for COVID-19 related services. Revenue here increased 5.4% year-over-year to $246.3 million, and operating profit margin improved to 10.9%, up from 8.4% last year. We benefit from the recapture of roughly $2 million of bad debt in this year's second quarter. But even adjusting for this, our profit margin still showed improvement. The growth in revenue and margin was fueled by a higher level of work orders and new customer contract wins for our services.\nEducation revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $214.2 million, representing the strongest growth rate among our segments in the second quarter. The acceleration in revenue growth primarily reflected the positive impact from the reopening of schools and other educational facilities in the second quarter and the shift toward more in-person learning.\nEducation operating profit totaled $13.6 million, representing a margin of 6.3%, slightly down year-over-year on an operating [Phonetic] basis as a result of labor challenges in our Southern U.S. operations.\nBad debt expense was roughly $1 million lower than last year, and this was a contributing factor to the operating profit improvement we experienced in this segment. Although the specific labor costs I mentioned will not recur in the third quarter, we anticipate that the return of students to school on a full-time basis will lead to some reduction in labor efficiency within this segment in the second half.\nAviation revenue declined 19.7% in the second quarter to $148.3 million. Although reduced global travel continues to weigh on this segment, revenue improved 3.6% on a sequential basis, marking the third consecutive quarter that Aviation segment revenue has improved sequentially. With industry data points indicating a progressive recovery in global travel, we are optimistic that revenue in our Aviation segment will continue to improve over the second half of fiscal 2021.\nAviation operating profit was $5.8 million, representing a margin of 3.9%. While our airline customers continue to request higher margin enhanced cleaning services such as electrostatic spraying, margin remain below normalized levels given reduced volumes.\nAs Scott mentioned, we are focused on securing more profitable overall business with airports and related facilities and have continued to de-emphasize our airline services work. This strategic shift in our Aviation segment business mix had a positive revenue and margin impact on our second quarter results and should benefit future periods as well.\nTechnical Solutions revenue increased 2.6% year-over-year to $125.5 million. Operating margin was 8.2% in the second quarter, up significantly from 5.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to a favorable mix of higher-margin projects. As client site access improves, we remain positive on the growth trajectory of the Technical Solutions segment.\nShifting now to our cash and liquidity. We ended the second quarter with $435.7 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $394.2 million at the end of fiscal 2020. With total debt of $797.9 million as of April 30th, 2021, our total debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including standby letters of credit, was 1.7 times for the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\nSecond quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations was $125.9 million, down from $162.3 million in the same period last year. The decline in cash flow from continuing operations during the second quarter was primarily due to the timing of cash taxes.\nFor the six month period ending April 30th, 2021, operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $171.2 million. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $117 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and $156 million for this year's first half. As a reminder, cash flow is benefiting from payroll tax deferral related to the CARES Act. Beginning next year, the deferral will be paid at $66 million in each of the next two years.\nWe were pleased to pay our 220th consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.19 per common share during the second quarter, returning an additional $12.7 million to our shareholders. Our Board also declared our 221st consecutive quarterly dividend, which will be payable in August to shareholders of record on July 1st.\nSupported by the strength of our balance sheet, we have the financial resources to support our capital allocation priority of adding additional growth by investing organically while pursuing potential acquisitions.\nNow, I'll provide some additional color on our guidance and outlook. As mentioned, our increased guidance for full year fiscal 2021 adjusted income from continuing operations is now a range of $3.30 to $3.50 per diluted share compared to $3.00 to $3.25 previously.\nOur upward revised adjusted earnings forecast reflects the strength of our first half as well as our positive view for the second half. As a reminder, our third quarter has one fewer day than last year, equivalent to about $6 million and reduced labor expense.\nOn a GAAP basis, we continue to expect EPS from continuing operations of $2.85 to $3.10, inclusive of the $0.32 litigation reserve in the second quarter. We continue to expect a 30% tax rate for fiscal 2021, excluding discrete items such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credits and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards.\nAs we noted in our first quarter conference call in March, our expectation was to achieve cash flow above our historical range of $175 million to $200 million for fiscal 2021. Now having generated $171 million of operating cash flow in the first half alone, we are confident that we will achieve free cash flow for fiscal 2021 of $215 million to $240 million.\nWe are pleased with our positioning, as business across the country emerge from the pandemic and we look forward to helping our clients provide safe environment for their employees and customers. And I am personally looking forward to meeting with each of you in person, hopefully as soon as later this year and to connecting with you virtually until then.\nOperator, we are now ready for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Mulrooney -- William Blair -- Analyst\nGood morning, Scott. Good morning, Earl.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nEarl Ellis -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nTim Mulrooney -- William Blair -- Analyst\nThank you guys for taking my questions. So, a couple of questions on labor; first labor cost and then labor availability. On the labor cost side, last quarter you said that you anticipated retaining most of your labor arbitrage through year-end. That is a big part of your margin expansion coming from labor savings. But here we are a couple of months later and inflation is on the rise and on the forefront of everyone's mind, do you think the piece of your margin expansion that came from labor savings over the last 12 months, is it your expectation that eventually gets inflated away in the coming periods?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, that's a good question. So, I mean the answer is yes and we've consistently said that. But I think it's important, Tim, to level set this. And just as a reminder, you know 50% of our revenues come from unionized labor, which is above market wage and having benefits. So, we never really see pressure there. So it's really on the other 50%. So, we have mitigation right there.\nAnd for us, as we think about labor and what we're doing, we put together a pod for this just like we did during COVID when we talked about how we created these task forces. So, we have kind of a multi-discipline task force just focused on recruiting and labor efficiencies right now. And we're hyper targeting certain areas because not every area is built the same, right? There are places like Orlando and Dallas and Houston, which have a little bit more pressure than other areas. And again, we're only really mostly focused on the non-union areas.\nSo, I think it's something that's top of mind for us, but I always point people back to 2018 and 2019 when there were labor pressures as well and how we navigated there. And it is what we do, right? So eventually, we will see some of the efficiencies trail off, which is what we said because people will return to work and we'll be restaffing the buildings. But we are going to maintain some of those savings because of efficiencies of restaffing. So, we feel good about that.\nAnd then, the last thing I'll say about the labor pressures is, we do ultimately get this back from our customers. It's not exactly elastic, but we pass through and we've shown in '18 and '19 that as labor costs rise, we're really good at recapturing those from customers because they get it, because they're facing the same thing. So it's not anything that's kind of just segmented to our industry. So again, top of mind, but we feel like we got this.\nTim Mulrooney -- William Blair -- Analyst\nOkay. That's very reassuring. Thanks Scott. Any of the investments that you've made recently, is there anything there that would help you pass on this cost in a different way, new capabilities that you have -- that you hadn't had before? Or is that not really related to this piece of the business?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIt's not necessarily related to this piece of business. But I will tell you, the first tranche of our technology path was a couple of years ago when we upgraded our HR system and went to the cloud and got a -- again, much better capability.\nSo it helps us have insight and information that we never had a couple of years ago. And in this kind of labor game, the key is having information, knowing where the pressure points are, knowing how to articulate and dynamically staff. So, I'd say the newer investments are not necessarily exactly related to labor because, fortunately, we got ahead of that fortuitously.\nTim Mulrooney -- William Blair -- Analyst\nUnderstood. If I could just squeeze one more in. I wanted to ask about labor availability. I mean you guys had 114,000 employees toward the year end. And I know this was down from 2019, but still more employees than pretty much every other company on my coverage list. So my question here is not about labor cost, it's about labor availability. Most companies I talk to list labor availability as the prevailing issue right now even more so than inflation. So, is labor availability a major issue for you right now? And if so, has this affected service levels in any material way?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So -- funny, I would say, probably for our 112-year history, labor availability is always top of mind, right, because of what we do, alright. But what I would say is this, I'd say it's still little early in the game, right? There was a federal stimulus out there of $300 a week, which we all know about, over and above unemployment.\nAnd you do the math on that, you think about a $15,000 a year bump for people who are on unemployment. So that's something that keeps people at home and we're starting to see some of the states roll it off starting this month. And in September, the federal program rolls off.\nSo, I think it's a little early to see about what the labor availability will be in the fall when people return to work because that's when we'll really going to need it. But we don't have this massive need right now because, generally speaking, Tim, right now it's still very muted occupancy in office buildings, right, and travel, still only about 60% of where it was.\nSo, I think we'll have more to say on other companies. We're going to have more to say after the federal stimulus wears off and how many people reenter the workforce. So for now, we're navigating it well. But again, we'll acknowledge it's definitely at muted levels right now of lead, right? So, I think September is going to be the time where everybody is going to really understand what the availability pressures are. But I think anything before that is just speculation in our mind.\nTim Mulrooney -- William Blair -- Analyst\nOkay.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nIs that helpful? Does that make sense?\nTim Mulrooney -- William Blair -- Analyst\nYeah. That's very helpful. Understood. Thanks for taking my questions.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYou bet, Tim.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSean Eastman -- Keybanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and nice job, again, this quarter.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nSean Eastman -- Keybanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nI guess just going back to the margin discussion, the different moving parts there. I mean, we have an updated second half outlook, but it seems like the dynamic in the business doesn't really change too too much until the fall, September, October. So it's kind of right at the end of the fiscal year. I'm just wondering how much we can extrapolate from the second half about the updated margin guidance as we think about what's sustainable going into next year.\nI mean, I could just go round and round in circles around the different moving parts between labor efficiencies and how these IT investments trend, ATS coming back and being a growth driver again. I mean, is this implied second-half run rate sustainable? What are the big moving parts we really need to consider in our models going into next year relative to that run rate?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. So let's -- and obviously, we're not ready to guide yet for '22. So, I mean I have limited to say about that. But I could tell you, look, we feel super confident about the second half of this fiscal year for us. That's why we were able to raise guidance. And a lot of that honestly, Sean, has to do with having better line of sight. We've been really consistent about the fact that we want to be responsible and until we have line of sight, we're not going to get over our skis, right?\nSo, I think we have -- at this point in time, we feel like we have really good line of sight to the rest of this year and the dynamics looked really good. Between EnhancedClean and our work orders in the second half, they maintained at the levels of the first half. And we feel like it's going to be strong for the rest of this year. We believe there is going to be a return to work. Is it going to be a 100% of office occupancy? Absolutely not.\nBut we're probably seeing somewhere around 25% average across the country and probably more in the range of 40% in the Southern states and 16% on the Coast. So, we think that's going to tick up and return to work is going to be more revenues for us. It's going to be more disinfection services. We'll give a little bit of that back from the labor efficiencies because we'll have to restaff the buildings, but that's really a positive trend for us.\nAnd the last thing and you mentioned is, Technical Solutions, we have a backlog of over $250 million in business, our strongest ever and more importantly, our churn rate is up. We -- typically, our churn rates for the second quarter was somewhere in the range of 12%. But sequentially, through the quarter got stronger and stronger and so we're excited about that to actually churn to work.\nSo, I think you're going to see -- you're going to see revenues go up in the second half. You're going to see disinfection strong. You'll see, again, the mitigation on the labor side, but you're also going to see ATS churn up as well. So, I think we feel really good about that and we'll see where it goes into '22 as we get closer to that.\nAnd again, November 1st starts our '22, and I think that's still going to be at the time where people are returning to work. And so, I think we'll have a good start to '22 as well, but again, it's early to start guiding. Does that makes sense?\nSean Eastman -- Keybanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYeah. Yeah, it does. Okay. And obviously, the balance sheet is primed for some capital deployment here. Seems like you kind of stepped up your M&A commentary a little bit and your communications here this quarter. I mean, could you just talk -- speak to the velocity in the acquisition pipeline? I'm hearing from a lot of companies that sort of tell you the decision making is really accelerating here?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So there is definitely more activity. And remember, for us, we were pretty consistent last year that until we get through this pandemic, until we feel like there is stabilized liquidity and what have you, we won't going start thinking about it. So, we've only been in the game for a very short period of time, but we have our teams out there. There is activity.\nWe'd like to think there is going to be opportunity for us. And the nice thing for us as -- and you -- I'm not going to tell you anything you haven't heard about private equity and having access to capital. But the nice thing for us is that we as a strategic buyer have synergies, both operating and revenue that helps make us competitive if there is an attractive asset out there. So it's definitely a priority for us, M&A, because growth is so important. So, we're excited about what we're starting to see.\nSean Eastman -- Keybanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOkay. Excellent. I'll turn it over there. Thanks so much, Scott.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Sean.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\nGreat. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Scott, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that your B&I customers and some of your manufacturing customers, they're going to keep cleaning. Do you think that some of the enhanced cleaning services might become part of the contract? And so I just want to understand that mechanism a little bit more.\nDo you expect that those will be negotiated contracts? Or as they look to increase the size, do you think, generally speaking, that your customers, as they look to increase the amount of cleaning that they do, that they got to rebid with that? And what do you think, as these things become part of the base contract and less tag worker or work order work? What, if any, implications are there to the margins? What are your thoughts on that one?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, that's a great question. And I think -- you know what Andy, I think we've been really consistent for the past few quarters saying that the natural gravitation of this work will be to be embedded in scope because I mean, look, I was a former facility manager. That's what I would do, right?\nAnd so, I think as clients start thinking about retendering contracts, which will probably happen over the next year or two, I do see them incorporating in. It's a smart thing to do. And I think we've talked about 30% margins on this work. We'll see that trail down a little bit. I don't know where it will end up landing. Will it land at 20%? Will it land at 25%?\nBut the reality is for us, there is -- it's a higher value service and you can build in a higher margin for a higher value service. There is training. There is equipment. There is all these protocols. So, I think we'll be able to retain a good amount of the margin. But absolutely, the expectation is that it will gravitate into the base contracts for the bigger clients. For the smaller tenants, I think it's still going to be kind of on a work order basis, which would make sense for them as well.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\nThat makes sense. But as we sit here today in June, are you seeing those kinds of discussions happening or this is just still -- I mean, you've been saying this for a while, like you just said there, but are you seeing anything today that -- toward this trend here in June?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNot yet. You know why? Because people aren't really focused on rebidding contracts right now, right. I think if you think of the life of a facility manager right now, what's top of mind for them is preparing for return to work for all their workers, right. So they are looking at reoccupancy programs. They are looking at space planning for their offices, all the health and safety stuff.\nRebidding a janitorial contract is a pretty big deal and it takes a lot of focus and effort. So, my sense is that kind of thing is going to happen probably '22, '23 versus the back half of this year because we just haven't heard about any plans yet on scale to get in the market and rebid.\nAnd I think the other part of it, the insight I have, Andy, and maybe this is helpful is, when you don't know -- when you are a facility manager and you don't know what's your ultimate occupancy is going to be or floor layout, you're getting ahead of yourself by bidding the contract because you can't really drill down on a good scope yet, because you just don't know how it's all going to land.\nSo kind of -- if I were in their shoes, I would think it's premature right now to start putting together a formal scoping for what the new ways of work look like because people haven't really returned yet. Does that make sense?\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\nYeah, it makes a lot of sense. And just on Technical Solutions here, you guys put in electric vehicle charging stations, you retrofit schools with all kinds of different systems. Both of these things are talked about as having -- actually, some of these have passed the $1.9 trillion thing had money directly for schools.\nI'm wondering, I wouldn't expect that it's in the backlog yet, but are you bidding projects that you can kind of tie to these moneys that have been allocated already? You mentioned the record backlog, I'm just kind of curious as to -- if that's kind of before the stimulus here or after the stimulus and any comments that you have on that in particular?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I think the good news is we haven't seen yet the direct effect of that because a lot of these programs haven't been formalized. But I can tell you that this kind of bundling of solutions and our energies, we call it BES, which is Bundled Energy Solutions, which is this project retrofit work. We're seeing a lot of activity on that because there are still other government programs out there and any of the school districts can raise capital, where they're getting the pressure is on their operating margin still.\nSo, we're just seeing an increase on pipeline side of clients, who were talking about ways to lower operating expenses and that plays right into the strength of what we do with our -- again, our bundled energy solution. And then you take on top of that, the administration's new focus with decarbonization and e-mobility.\nOur easy charging is probably -- it's still a relatively small segment for us, but it's probably our fastest growing. And it's really turning into something that we're putting a lot of focus on. So, we think everything that's going on societally and with the administration is going to be a big tailwind for us in '22 and '23.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful. And then just last question quickly here for Earl. I wanted to talk about the unallocated corporate expense segment results. I mean, you guys -- you mentioned in the prepared remarks that your kind of $20 million of investments this year over last year, that's on track. You guys have been saying it's going to be $40 million for the year. Seems like that's kind of where you are on those investments.\nBut Earl, just wanted to make sure that for all of our models here that we're getting this right. [Indecipherable] last year's corporate and unallocated expense segment is going to be plus $40 million on these investments. But I also think that there is -- because the year is where it is, you mentioned in the press release even that the stock compensation is going to be up in addition to that.\nSo, I was just wondering if you just could help us a little bit as to how much the stock comp is up year-over-year as well, just so that we can kind of get a sense of what that line is. And then, obviously, the implications -- will it be rolled back into the implications for the operating segment margins as well? Just be kind of helpful to understand how you're thinking about that unallocated segment line?\nEarl Ellis -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure, Andy, would love to do that. So just to start with, as we mentioned last quarter, we're continuing to invest in both our talent to support our future growth opportunities as well as the planning and design phase of our tech solutions rollout -- for the rollout of our tech transformation. And as we mentioned, that investment year-over-year is approximately a $40 million increase.\nAnd when we look at the year-to-date, we've actually spent $20 million of that. Although if you recall in Q1, it was actually a little bit of a late start and that we actually spent probably about $3 million to $5 million of that, but caught up in the second quarter.\nAs we look to the back half of the year that $10 million clip we'll continue to spend over Q3 and Q4. Now having said that, however, when you look at it from a year-over-year perspective, it might look a little lumpy, in that if you look at Q3, you have to recall last year where we actually had the benefit of the furlough, you'll actually see as a result of that a tick up.\nAnd then, when you look to Q4, although we'll still be spending that $10 million, that spending actually started last year in Q4. And therefore, Q4 year-over-year will look kind of flattish, but we are still on track with the $40 million spend for this year.\nIn addition to that, we are seeing an increase in our share-based compensation and that's to the tune of approximately $15 million year-over-year. And that's a product of a number of things, including special grants that came up last year, as well as just how we're actually tracking on the grants that will actually come to vesting this year.\nAgain, you're going to see some lumpiness in that that year-over-year increase, you'll see the vast majority of that impacting in this past quarter, Q2 year-over-year as last year we took a significant reduction in our reserve, as we were anticipating the impacts of the pandemic. We then started to ramp up that investment last year, that accruals last year. So as you look at the back half of this year, we anticipate more a smoothing year-over-year with regards to share-based compensation.\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\nAll right. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Have a great day, guys.\nEarl Ellis -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Silver with CL King & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Silver -- CL King & Associates, Inc. -- Analyst\nYeah. Hi, good morning. So, maybe if I could just ask Earl to follow up a tiny bit on the stock-based comp discussion that you just finished. Always a number of moving parts in these programs, but for our understanding purposes going forward, should we be tracking, let's say, the closing -- the point-to-point change in your share price. In other words, January 31 to April 30 led to the bulk of that expense this quarter or is it more of an accrual with time or an average share price? In other words, might there be a couple of rules of thumb you could share that might give us a little bit of a heads up going forwards to kind of adjust our expectations for that expense item? Thank you.\nEarl Ellis -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. Well, when you look at our share-based compensation, for the most part, there are a number of metrics, but the large percentage is really -- metric is really weighted on our financial performance. And that would be both revenue as well as our EBITDA. So one of the things that you can clearly track is how we're actually progressing on those two metrics.\nAnd it's clear to say, especially, this year with regards to our EBITDA and our earnings that again, have been driven by the margin expansion; that really is the significant benefactor, if you will, to the increased accrual that we're actually seeing in the stock compensation plan.\nDavid Silver -- CL King & Associates, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you for that. And then, Scott, I had a question about the project reserve that your company took couple of quarters ago. So, I think it was $18 million pre-tax. But my understanding was that was kind of tied to the inability of your customer to kind of open or begin operations.\nWith the -- I was just wondering if you could give us an update there on whether you think the current pace of, let's say, the reopening of workplaces and social venues and things? I mean, should we be thinking that, that reserve might be reversed in coming quarters? And what's your -- maybe just an update on that issue, please.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So, look, I'm an eternal optimist, right. So -- but I will tell you, David, like we're in active discussions and it's something it's really difficult to comment on because we are still -- it's still ongoing. So, just like any other kind of reserve we take, we don't give up and we go after it. And so I think, suffice to say, active conversations and more to come on that.\nDavid Silver -- CL King & Associates, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, maybe just one more kind of bigger picture question. And this would have to do with branding, I guess, or your marketing strategies and your marketing programs to-date. So, you've mentioned in the past you have ramped up marketing efforts on a number of platforms and I've seen your national commercial on CNBC quite a bit. And two things. I mean, first, I was just wondering if you could point to any tangible results in particular, product lines or sub-sectors that where you think the greater awareness, the greater visibility has made a difference?\nAnd then secondly, maybe just a longer-term perspective. In other words, your company has been in business for over a century. You already have a national footprint and yet you kind of have redoubled your marketing efforts here. Maybe if you could just point to, maybe from a one or two-year perspective. I mean, where do you think that that greater awareness, the branding efforts are going to have the biggest effect?\nIn other words, might it encourage people who had been using maybe a regional player or a mom and a pop to step up to a higher level of service that they associate with your name now or maybe regionally areas where you hadn't been as -- that you're looking to penetrate? Maybe that's a necessary pre-condition for success there? So, just overall branding success to-date and then where do you think -- where should we look for the greatest impact over the next year or two? Thank you.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Yeah. So look, I think, especially with what we're doing with the commercial, brand is so important. And what you're trying to do is create differentiation in the market. And you hit on it, right. There is like kind of ABM and then there is regionalized competitors and what we are attempting to do and I think the pandemic has done it is, really, say, like there is kind of us and our resources and our scale and there is everybody else.\nAnd the way that that manifested itself is on our supply chain. We were never the ones that were without disinfectant or PPE for our people, electrostatic sprayers because of, again, our sourcing capability. And not every client that had a regional player can say that they fared as well. And then we had an advisory council that we put together of outside experts to synthesize what the CDC and the World Health Organization was saying, so our clients could get a better lens on that.\nAll these things, the small regional players couldn't do. And then you put on top of that commercials on CNBC, it's like -- it's just creating a choice differential that we think is going to be super impactful. Hopefully, that's going to have an impact on our retention over the next couple of years. We've been over 90%, a 1 percentage point tick up in retention is dramatic in our business. So, we're hoping that.\nWe've seen, last time I checked, and my information is a few weeks old, but I think it was something around a 10% increase in hits on our website. And our sales team is seeing tracking coming through digitally. So, I think it's a confluence of things, David, but again, it's elevating the brand between how we performed and the exposure now that we're doing on TV and through all the social channels. It's just -- it's going to -- all we're trying to do at ABM is create the separation between our platform and our small regional competitors.\nDavid Silver -- CL King & Associates, Inc. -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Thank you very much.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Marc Riddick with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nMarc Riddick -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst\nGood morning.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nEarl Ellis -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nMarc Riddick -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst\nSo, I wanted to just sort of fill in a few of the blanks that we've had from some of the other questions which were already answered. I wanted to start first with going back to the acquisition commentary in the press release and what you've talked about a little bit more recently. Just wanted to touch a little bit on whether or not there is any particular areas that you would view as priorities or things that are kind of top of the list that you'd like to see accomplish, whether it'd be a regional selling or a service line area. How should we think about your prioritization of potential acquisitions?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. So, look, I think for us, we're very intent on sticking to our core, right? And the core of what we do is janitorial stationing, engineering, right? And that with the pandemic and what's happened through all virus protection and our credibility there, we think that's a great accelerator for us. So, we will look for scale there. And you know how much we love the ATS work, right? It's our fastest growing and most profitable segment. So, we have a high interest in growing that platform too.\nSo you know what Marc, I think before we start looking for adjacencies outside of the core of what we do, we're really going to stick within the core and scale is always better, right? Integrating a small company is as much work as integrating a big company. So, I think we're going to synthesize those. And then there are certain regions even with our -- with our ATS work, there are certain regions that we'd like to fill in, where we're maybe not as strong as others.\nSo, there'll be a little bit of a geographic dent when it comes to ATS. So, we have a really good metrics of what we're looking for. And what we said for the past few years is what I'd say now, we are not going to be reactive. We're going to be strategic and planful on how we go after acquisitions.\nMarc Riddick -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst\nGreat. And then, I wanted to switch back to talking about some of the segment actively seen during the quarter because one of things that was interesting to me was the strongest segment growth was in Education. It seems as though of all the areas of your work, that seem to have been the biggest beneficiary of the strength of the rollout of vaccines and what have you.\nI was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about some of the conversations that you're having within the education space and maybe some of the commentary there or maybe what you're seeing from the benefits of funding that kind of gives you -- it seems as though it gives you greater confidence for the upcoming school year.\nBut certainly, the vaccines seems to have accelerated activity at the very end of this school year. But it also seems to maybe have accelerated the timing of some of those conversations. So, just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about that?\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. That's a good question. From the educators, we've been talking to within our client base and stuff we hear in the industry, it seems to be this very binary shift toward in-person learning and the whole remote when it comes to the fall, right? So that's really the next -- really piece of the puzzle right now that school is generally out right now. We're talking about in-person, which is great from a revenue standpoint for us.\nAgain, we'll give some of it back on the labor efficiency. But all the educators we talk to, healthy, clean, safe buildings is top of mind. And it's for them and the parents, right? Parents are very vocal about this. So, we're excited about the potential in education because we suspect, if you look at our different segments, right, our technology and manufacturing, which is really focused as much on manufacturing side, they never stop and our revenues always remained strong.\nAnd then you had our B&I, which is office occupancy reduction, right. I think Aviation is one that's going to lag probably more than any other segment. But Education, I think it's going to have a strong come back in the fall, whereas when you look at B&I, I don't think anyone thinks that offices are going to be a 100% occupied in the fall, whereas it could be close to that for Education. So, I think you're going to see a pretty strong rebound.\nMarc Riddick -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst\nRight. Right. And then the last thing for me, totally different area, but I was wondering if you can give updated thoughts around -- given the strength of free cash flow generation, debt reduction was substantial than we were expecting. Certainly, nice to see there. Wanted to talk a little bit about views of future share repurchase and how we should think about, sort of given the strength of the business versus where your stock price is now, kind of how your thoughts are evolving there? Thanks.\nEarl Ellis -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, it's Earl, Marc. Thanks for the questions. I would say that we're really pleased with the amount of cash that we're currently sitting on as well as our low leverage, which really gives us the opportunity now really to deploy that capital for the purposes of supporting our long-term growth strategy. And as such, we are going to be looking to invest in both organic as well as inorganic growth.\nNow having said that, we're going to remain our flexibility with regards to capital allocation. As you know, we currently have authorization upwards of about $145 million from the Board to actually pursue share buybacks. So, we'll keep that flexibility as time proceeds. But at this point in time, the focus really is around allocating capital for growth purposes for long-term growth, Marc.\nMarc Riddick -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst\nThank you very much.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Marc.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Salmirs for any final comments.\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I just want to take a moment to thank everyone for supporting us through this period. So proud of what our team members have done and appreciate the interest from our investor base and analysts based on what we're doing.\nAnd you can tell that there is a strong level of enthusiasm about the future for ABM between the brand elevation, between our margin elevation and about societal reflections on virus protection going forward. We think we're just in a super good spot to continue to invest in and accelerate the platform.\nAnd the most important thing is just, we're not out of this yet and I would just urge everybody to not let their guard down and stay safe through this. And we have good things coming. So, thank you all for the time today. Really appreciate it.\nOperator\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\nDuration: 60 minutes\nCall participants:\nDavid Gold -- Investor Relations\nScott Salmirs -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nEarl Ellis -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nTim Mulrooney -- William Blair -- Analyst\nSean Eastman -- Keybanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAndrew Wittmann -- Robert W.

Following management's prepared remarks, we will open the call [Audio gap]\nLisa Kampf -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nEveryone, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Super Group's results for the second quarter of 2022 and outlook for the year. During this call, we may make comments of a forward-looking nature that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed further in our SEC filings that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from our forecast. We see no responsibility to update forward-looking statements other than as required by law. Additionally, on today's call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measure.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and not a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in the press release issued earlier today and available on the Investor Relations page of Super Group's websites. Also, please note that we have posted a supplemental presentation to the Investor Relations section of our company website, along with the press release, the link to the replay of this webcast, and filings with the SEC. The presentation includes the financial information that will be referred to during this call.\nToday, I'm joined with Neal Menashe, chief executive officer; and Alinda Van Wyk, chief financial officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions, and we will also be joined by Richard Hasson, president and chief operating officer. And now I would like to turn the call over to Neal. \nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Super Group is and continues to be uniquely positioned to take full advantage of the projected growth in the global online betting and gaming market, a sector expected to exceed $140 billion by 2025. Our Betway and Spin brand enjoy worldwide reach and recognition.\nAnd we are actively working on a number of geographic opportunities that will allow us to deliver future growth. And most importantly, our business is diversified, profitable, and highly cash generative. This quarter, we again demonstrated the benefits of our global model and recently formed a holding company structure, which with good progress made in a number of areas. We grew average monthly active customers to 2.7 million, up 3% from the second quarter of 2021.\nWe saw good growth in key markets such as Africa and Asia Pacific. Our sports betting continued to deliver positive growth. We kept a smooth Ontario license process with the transition of Betway into the regulated regime with Spin to follow next week. And we have progressed the U.S.\nstate per state licensing of Super Group that is a prerequisite for the acquisition of Digital Gaming Corporation, DGC. Our results of this quarter of net gaming revenue of EUR 316 million and adjusted EBITDA of EBITDA 54 million and for the half year of net gaming revenue of EUR 631 million and adjusted EBITDA of EUR 117 million remain resilient despite the impact of the normalization of entertainment spending patterns post-COVID and the current headwind effects of general economic uncertainty on discretionary spending. We expect that these effects will continue to be felt for the remainder of the year and have updated our guidance accordingly. Alinda will discuss both our results and our guidance in more detail shortly but I want to emphasize two things first.\nOne, I believe that our year-on-year results do not properly reflect our treatment over the last 12 months. Our continued progress across the globe is better reflected by growing global tabs on loan growth in active customer numbers. Two, ongoing regulatory change post-COVID normalization will ultimately benefit Super Group because we have an efficient cost structure and only -- over 20 years track record of trading profitably through thick and thin. Importantly, our control over marketing, our products, and our operating costs gives us a number of levers to optimize them.\nHere is what we are doing. First, efficient brand spend to maintain global awareness. We will continue to optimize our portfolio of over 60 worldwide partnerships by focusing on profit. Second, we will enter new markets and expand in existing markets, particularly where regulatory changes provide opportunity.\nIn the absence of the cost attractive ROI, we will reduce or delay spending. Third, over the next 18 months, as we extract cost efficiencies arising from the formation of the holding company with significant savings to be delivered in 2023. Turning now to some specific market-related updates. In Canada, we are pleased to report the smooth transition last week of Betway from Ontario-regulated environment and we expect Spin to migrate next week.\nGiven the regulatory restrictions of public advertising of bonuses in Ontario, we don't expect to see the same level of unsustainable price competition that happened in the United States. We remain confident from past experience that regulation will be favorable for us in the medium and long run, and we hope to see regulation introduced to Canada's other provinces in due course. In the meantime, we will continue to trade as before, and we expect that Canada will continue to underpin our 20-year track record of consistent profitability and cash generation. Some of our historically key Western European markets continue to be on hold.\nWe are still awaiting license in the Netherlands in anticipation of launch, and we have not yet concluded the assessment of ongoing viability of casino gaming in Germany post the new regulation. In the United States, our goal of completing the acquisition of DGC remains at the end of this year but is, of course, subject to various regulatory timelines. To recap, DGC is a brand licensee of Betway, currently live in seven states and with secured market access in up to 12. DGC will be tremendous addition to Super Group and the fastest and most efficient way for us to enter the U.S.\nWe look forward to completing the regulatory approvals and having DGC become part of Super Group as soon as possible. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consistent cash generation built a strong balance sheet that is an asset to Super Group. For cash on hand, we are considering various opportunities, including investing in brand and other marketing channels to generate profitable long-term growth, M&A for expansion to new and existing markets or the acquisition of useful skills or technology.\nDGC is a good example of this, and returning cash to shareholders. Under returning cash, in our first annual general meeting in September, we'll offer the authorization to buy back share. This is a typical and standard step for the company and we want that authorization to be able to act if it's in the country's best -- company's best interest. However, we are paying close attention to the notes closed and any use of this authorization would keep that in mind.\nIn conclusion, let me sum it up for you. We believe that online gaming businesses are resilient, but they are not immune to macroeconomic pressures. What Super Group has is a global footprint and a competitive cost structure that we intend to keep and improve. We are experiencing these pressures, but our underlying business is healthy and we continue and will continue to grow over time.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, our business fundamentals are sound, and we'll stay focused on long-term opportunities around the world. Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Alinda for a detailed discussion of our financial results. Alinda?\nAlinda Van Wyk -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Neal. As you are well aware, 2022 has been a difficult year for many industries, including the global digital gaming industry. With changes in consumer behavior driven by economic uncertainty, revenue growth has slowed down. In the second quarter, Super Group's net gaming revenue was EUR 316 million, down 7% versus the prior year quarter.\nHowever, on a consistent basis, excluding European markets that were closed for us this year due to regulatory changes, net gaming revenue in the second quarter had decreased by 5%. Looking at the first half of this year, Super Group's net gaming revenue is down by only 1% from 2021 to EUR 631 million. Back to the positive results. We also experienced a shift in revenue mix.\nIn quarter 2 2021, our net gaming revenue was split 50-50 between Betway and Spin. This year during the second quarter, Betway grew to 55% against Spin's 45% and sports betting grew while casino gaming declined. This shift in revenue mix negatively impacts our EBITDA margin owing to Betway's lower operating margin as compared to Spin. Starting with our Sportsbook revenue.\nCompared to Q2 last year, Sportsbook revenue increased by 6 million or 6%, mainly due to good growth in key markets in Africa and outback regions. Despite being partially offset by declines in Europe and Canada, growth in sports betting net gaming revenue from Africa and outback markets represent positive momentum resulting from continued good growth on the customer base and retention rates in some of the few markets where it would appear that the COVID lockdowns had relatively limited impact. The growth in APAC impact was also due to the full IPL season during 2022 after the cancellation of the IPL season in 2021 due to COVID. The decline in Europe was mostly due to regulatory changes in Germany and Netherlands and fewer sports offerings in 2022, in particular with limited soccer in June this year.\nOn that note, the English Premier League and France Ligue 1 kicked off again last weekend and we are seeing an encouraging increase in activity. We look forward to other major European leagues starting this weekend. In conjunction with our EPL brand partnerships as the home of 380 games, will feature some of Betway's branding, including our sponsorship of Wisdom. Other upcoming events include the T20 Cricket World Cup in October-November, followed by the FIFA Soccer World Cup in November and December.\nMoving over to casino. Casino gaming revenue decreased by 29 million or 12%, compared with the same quarter in 2021, of which EUR 4 million can be attributed to the closure of Netherlands with the remainder primarily due to the decline in iGaming revenue in Canada. We believe that the decline in Canada is due to a combination of two things. People are getting back to normal behaviors post-COVID and inflation is putting pressure on spending.\nSimilar factors can be seen in several of our markets across the globe, but the impact is felt most in Canada as that is our largest market. Despite all of this, our total average monthly active customers increased over 3% to 2.7 million, compared to 2.6 million in the prior year quarter. Super Group is well on its way to achieving a diverse mass market business. Onto EBITDA.\nWe continue to present adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA adjusted for fair value adjustments on warrants and earnout liability, associated foreign exchange movements, and non-recurring expenses. On that basis, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was down 36% or 30 million to 54 million, compared to 84 million in the prior year period. Looking at the half year, adjusted EBITDA for the six month period was 117 million, a decrease of only 21% from 2021. This quarter, the steeper decline in EBITDA compared to the decline in net gaming revenue resulted from several factors.\nBrand licensing revenue declined by EUR 12 million in the second quarter of 2022. On the expense side, variable or direct expenses decreased by 2% as compared to prior year quarter. Gaming taxes and product costs fell in line with revenue, but this was offset by an increase in payment processing and related foreign exchange cost due to growth in markets with those costs structurally higher. Super Group's marketing costs went down by 7 million or 8% on a net basis.\nA reduction of our variable marketing was offset by continued marketing investments in partnership deals for long-term brand and revenue growth. General and administrative costs, which is largely fixed in nature, increased by 6 million or 10%. Reason for this increase include nominal annual salary increases, increased technology and infrastructure costs, and the cost of additional corporate governance requirements following our public listing back in January. Looking at our financial position, our balance sheet remains strong with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of EUR 220 million at the end of June with no debt.\nOur cash flow ratio for the year so far is 74%. Onto our guidance. In addition to revising our guidance, to take into account the current conditions, we will be reporting revenue as opposed to net gaming revenue going forward. This is because the structure in Ontario as well as certain other jurisdictions as a company like Super Group operating as an agent of the authorities or the license holders.\nWhat that means in simple terms is that our reported revenue will include net gaming revenue in some jurisdictions, agency revenue net of fees in other jurisdictions, and other revenue such as brand license income. Back to the numbers. For the full year, we project revenue for 2022 under the new definition to range between EUR 1.15 billion and EUR 1.28 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range between EUR 200 million and EUR 250 million. For the EBITDA bridge to the original guidance, please refer to the presentation on the website.\nI want to emphasize that our new revenue projection is not a pure NGR because of the change you just mentioned. However, NGR still remains at our core. Some of the material assumptions underpinning our revised guidance. Sorry.\nI'm just going to go back to the numbers. I just want to reiterate the guidance. The definition for guidance has changed to revenue, as noted. The net gaming revenue -- the revenue guidance will be between EUR 1.15 billion and EUR 1.28 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range between EUR 200 million and EUR 215 million.\nSome of the material assumptions underpinning our revised guidance. Firstly, projected revenue has been reduced from prior guidance after taking into consideration expected ongoing pressures from multiple economic and regulatory headwinds, together with some further degree of post-COVID normalization. Brand license revenue for the remainder of 2022 is expected to remain lower at approximately EUR 2 million per month. Brand marketing being kept at the levels consistent with our earlier forecast because our focus on investing remains for the long term.\nAnd finally, operating cost is expected to be higher in 2022 due to inflation and additional costs of being a public company. The net effect is that we expect EBITDA margin to be approximately 17% to 19%. This is not the margin that we consider acceptable in the long term and we are actively reviewing and carefully optimizing all of our costs while working to extract the benefit of the holding company structure that we implemented in connection with becoming a public company just over six months ago. We expect some of the benefits from this to accrue this year, but meaningful impact will be noticed in 2023 when we expect to realize EUR 20 million to EUR 25 million decrease in annual overhead costs due to efficiencies.\nI also want to briefly touch on our projections. We received some entirely justified critical feedback following our withdrawal of estimates, coupled with a lack of specific details in this time of our call last quarter. We run our global business with a long-term mindset. Making and then possibly adjusting projections in the short term is sometimes something that is new to us, and we have taken steps to improve our ability and comfort in providing more transparency while still protecting our competitive interests.\nIn conclusion, results for the second quarter of 2022 are evidence of the difficulties of dealing with regulatory changes, post-COVID normalization, and economic uncertainties. We are focused on implementing a leaner cost structure, carefully balanced against future growth prospects in order to preserve our financial strength as we seek to continue to expand our global footprint and drive existing revenues ever possible, regardless of our challenges. I will now turn the call back to Neal for his final remarks.\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Alinda. In summary, we generated a healthy level of revenue and EBITDA for the quarter and we remain uniquely positioned in the global online gaming universe. We are digital only. We have a diverse global footprint across sports betting and iGaming.\nWe are in control of our tech stack, our data, and our algorithms. We are profitable, debt free, and highly cash generative. And we have a team that's been weathering these types of challenges for over two decades. Some of these challenges may be around for a few quarters, but Super Group is a strong company with a healthy balance sheet and we will continue to go after profitable growth.\nThank you. I'll now turn the call over to operator to open the call up for questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Also joining the management team today for question-and-answer is Richard Hasson, president and chief operating officer of Super Group. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Tilchen with Canaccord Genuity.\nPlease go ahead.\nJason Tilchen -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nYeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to focus on Canada a bit.\nYou mentioned both inflationary pressures and sort of normalizing behavior compared to the COVID impact from last year for the declines there. I'm just wondering if the read through there is that competition from sort of more operators in the market was not a factor there or just less of a factor. And maybe you can just as a follow up, also touch on the delay in the licensing for Spin and whether last quarter you talked about you're still able to operate in as you were previously with regulator knowledge. I'm wondering if that took place throughout the entire period from last quarter to now or if there's any change to that.\nThanks. Thanks a lot.\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK. So I'll take that. So yes, with Canada, as with all other markets, we operate in, there is competition. There's competition in all our markets.\nSo for us is Canada is we're the same company as we were a year ago. Canada is all about, obviously, gaming now regulated in Ontario with Betway went last week and then Spin going next week. So up to now they've been operating on the old software and they've now moved over. And Betway in the last seven to eight days is in line with our expectations.\nSo Spin's going next week. So we've learned a lot from Betway and then we can implement that into Spin.\nOperator\nThank you. Question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham and Co. Please go ahead.\nBernie McTernan -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe to start, if you could talk about the 20 million to 25 million of cost reductions. Just to be clear on the timing, are those all happening in '22? So you'll receive the full benefit in 2030? And then given the cost reductions, is 25% EBITDA margin something that's achievable in '23?\nAlinda Van Wyk -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Bernie. Alinda here. We started the process and we've -- it was a continuous process anyway since our listing to look at our cost base. In my presentation, I make references.\n2022 is where we really started to focus. We will see it in the last quarter coming to fruition. But the impact of the 20 million to 25 million is in 2023 and that will obviously be visible on the margin. And to your question regarding the 25% margin, I mean, obviously, like I said, the 17% to 19% margin is not where we would like to be.\nWe're aiming for 20% and continuous growth in that margin by getting all our ratios back intact with a focus on our top-line growth.\nBernie McTernan -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\nUnderstood and would just love some commentary in terms of what you're seeing from the customer LTVs and -- because of the macro? And what -- in the COVID comparisons, whether it's players turning off altogether, whether people are playing less and engaging less, if it's smaller bet size, less handle. We just like to see what's actually happening underneath the hood.\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nFirst of all, listen, it's across the globe. Because we're global, it's not just one country, it's across the globe. So you see different effects in different markets. But definitely from our point of view is it's just that the discretionary spend of our customer is has come down.\nBut in other markets, they -- we've got more customers so maybe their spend is slightly down but then we are -- they are spending more over time with us because we've got more customers. So it's definitely a macroeconomic headwind but that's why I said it's -- as this levels out, then -- and post-COVID, we are being [Inaudible]. As I say, we still got 2.7 million users using our software and that's going up.\nBernie McTernan -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nHey, Neal, Richard, Alinda. Thanks, guys. Good morning or afternoon, wherever you guys are. [Inaudible]\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nThe -- I guess just to double click on the macro again. It seemed like the online casino player was historically been fairly resilient in times of sort of economic distress. And while we have inflation, we also have strong employment. And of course, you're global and I'm looking from a U.S.\nlens. So I guess if we could again, I guess sort of understand why it's different this time. And I think you mentioned that perhaps your sports betting client was doing better than your gaming. I think I heard that.\nI'm just curious if that's true and why that is.\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo first of all, gaming's not immune, right. It's resilient but again, we've never seen inflation like this in 40 to 50 years. In our now 20 years, we haven't seen it yet. We've seen downturns in 2008 with financial crisis, but not something that's affected our customer's discretionary spend.\nSo -- but because we're global, different markets and including sports have different customer values, etc. But from our point of view, again, it's about what's happening in each of these countries, each of these markets, and how and how the customers are engaging on our platform.\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nFair enough. Inflation's brutal. I agree with you. I guess so.\nWhen your players are strained, I mean, how do you adjust your playbook or your app to sort of account for that weakness? I mean, how does that sort of change your whole target? How does that change your promotional activity? What adjustments have you made or do you plan to make for a player that is dealing with macro issues that could extend for another six to 18 months? Then I guess that becomes to your customer accounts again. And it's having more customers spending slightly less but in different markets they are different player. There are baskets, etc., for that. So from our point of view, remember, this business is a mass market business.\nThis is not a business of high valued customers. This is a business across the spectrum. So it's about the numbers of customers and your software being able to be superior in those markets and giving them the customer entertainment experience that they want and offering them the right casino games that they like it. But if it's lower bet size games.\nAnd remember, our algorithms and everything that we do is based on the -- is individualized to the customers. And then same with sports betting, it's offering them all the different sports events that they would like to bet on. And that's why we're saying when you've got lots of these competitions, for example, last year, this in June, last year we had the euro and now we didn't have the World Cup this year, but the World Cup is coming in November and December. So when you compare this June to last June, it isn't a fair comparison.\nSo all of that helps with when bringing the customers into the software and then they'll play better.\nOK. Fair enough. The last question for me is on the U.S. market.\nI'm sorry if I missed this. Are you -- just sort of the timeline, I guess, on DGC. It seems like it's been hanging out there for a while. Curious -- sorry again, Neal, you mentioned this, but just where you are in closing that transaction.\nAnd then maybe just reexamine, given everything that's changed so fast in terms of the macro conditions, how you're thinking about entering the U.S. market today versus six months or a year ago, and how you think about the impact to your '23 numbers. I think, Alinda, originally you're saying it was sort of a these are my numbers. Maybe it was 8 million to 13 million in annual negative adjusted EBITDA impact.\nJust curious if that's still the same range you're thinking and if your intent or your playbook or design of going to the U.S. market is the same given all the volatility. Thanks, guys.\nRichard Hasson -- President and Chief Operating Officer\nHi, there. Richard here. So the closing of the DGC acquisition is still on track for our target, our goal of having that done by the end of the year. As you mentioned before, there are a number of licenses that Super Group needs to be granted before that time.\nSo we're obviously working to the timelines of the regulators in those various states. So that remains our goal. In terms of the U.S., our plan remains very much the same. The -- in terms of the 2023 targets, in terms of the 2023 numbers, we expect the range of impact to EBITDA assuming that DGC is within the Super Group for the whole year to be between EUR 50 million and EUR 70 million with our target break even for the end of 2024, beginning of 2025.\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nThank you, guys.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nHey. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just two, if I may.\nCircling back to the macro, can you talk about what regions you're sort of seeing impacting that due to the higher dollar? Because just trying to reconcile with what you're seeing. I know you're global versus what we heard last week from some of the North American operators where they're not seeing an impact and you also heard that in travel as well, particularly Europe and travel in Europe is stronger. So are you seeing more of an impact in APAC and Africa? And then just on the change in the revenue, can you talk about like is that a benefit or can you talk about how that that impacts the financials and the growth rates? Thank you.\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK. So I'll just say because we -- we're the same company as we always have been. So because we're in the global marketplace across the world, of course, we have currency fluctuations but coming out of Africa, APAC, etc., right. So from us, those currencies are always swinging against the dollar's or the euro's, right.\nSo that, we've had anyway and we continue to grow the revenues in those markets despite -- even if it is offset slightly by some currency losses in those markets. But that's the global nature of Super Group and from that point of view. So for us is yes, and we -- I can't comment on our competitors. But remember, we are not in the U.S.\nWe are across the world. So we have global factors across the world in the market that we operate in.\nAlinda Van Wyk -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd then just on your question regarding the guidance for revenue, we -- the guidance is high quality revenue. I'm being very precise in the reforecast because to make sure that it's a strong, achievable target for all our businesses and to make sure that it's the high quality revenue that comes through and that our teams are very focused on are now achieving for the remainder of the year.\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nAnd then it seems that you're going -- you're getting live in Ontario this week. Is there a margin drag or anything we should be thinking about from paying like a higher tax rate or anything now that you're going to be, I guess, on the legalized or not legalized, but regulated -- you'll be a regulated operator in Ontario. How should we think about that in the back half on the margins?\nAlinda Van Wyk -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So it -- I mean, like previously stated as well, the initial introduction into the regulatory environment is always a bit of an impact on the margin, but we've got all systems in place to make sure that margin is recovered toward the end of the year with the most important impact is that even though you've got -- I referred to it as agency fee, which is the tax that you're implying about, the most important thing is that we that we -- that the costs associated is -- should theoretically come down as well, like better processing capabilities so your variable cost is in line then will be reduced. But also, our cost base is intact for that Ontario transfer and to make sure that our margins for Ontario is as per expectation of our guidance.\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. And then just one more for me. Just as we look out to next year sort of the countries the Netherlands, Germany, where you're having the regulatory headwinds, I mean, do you expect to be operating in those countries next year? And can that actually become a tailwind or how should we think about that? Thank you.\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo. Well, Germany, we're still operating in Germany. So just there's no casino in Germany but Netherlands, we're still working with the regulator but it's not in any of our guidance for 2022.\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nWhat about what about '23 would you be expected to be operating there?\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, yeah. So Germany, yes. And then Netherlands, we have said it all depends on the regulators in that market.\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nOK. So that would be an additional market you're live in for next year.\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, yeah, yeah. But Germany, we're currently live with now. We just don't have iCasino. So it depends on the iCasino and the taxes that they want in Germany will then depend if it's feasible for us to do iCasino, iGaming in Germany.\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nLisa Kampf -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nNeal Menashe -- Chief Executive Officer\nAlinda Van Wyk -- Chief Financial Officer\nJason Tilchen -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nBernie McTernan -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nRichard Hasson -- President and Chief Operating Officer\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nMore SGHC analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts"}

[Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Daley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael J. Daley -- Vice President-investor Relations and Controller\nThank you. On behalf of our management team, I would like to welcome you to our quarterly earnings conference call. Joining me on our call today are Phil Sanders, our CEO; Brent Bloss, our President; Ben Clouse, CFO; Dan Hanson, our CIO; Shawn Mihal, President of our Wealth Management business, Waddell & Reed, Inc.; and Amy Scupham, President of Ivy Distributors, Inc.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of our comments and responses may include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. While we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable based on information that is currently available to us, actual results could materially differ from those expressed or implied due to a number of factors that we reference in our public filings with the SEC.\nWe assume no duty to update any forward-looking statements. Materials relevant to today's call, including a copy of the press release that contains a description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to GAAP and supplemental schedules, have been posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.waddell.com.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Phil.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. The second quarter brought our country, the economy and the stock markets on an unusual journey, as we started the period in the depths of a dramatic downturn amid the global pandemic. Despite the ongoing health pandemic, social unrest in the U.S. and economic uncertainty throughout the period, the U.S. stock market returned one of its strongest quarters since 1998.\nThanks, in part, to a broad and rapid Central Bank policy stimulus, investors have generally recovered much of what was lost through the downturn earlier this year. Historically, the typical market recovery from a recession has taken two to three years or more. This recovery to date has progressed quickly, although its sustainability remains in question. Enthusiasm about a gradual reopening of the economy has been muted by ongoing uncertainty regarding the resurgence of public health risks in more parts of the country and a concern that Q3 and Q4 could be more challenging from a public health perspective. Broadly, the financial markets remain strong.\nWhile concern about another downturn remains, we do expect to see continued market leadership from companies with high-quality business models, which have delivered more consistent results. We believe this type of market environment is well suited for the Ivy approach to active investing, where we invest based on fundamentals, business models, management, leadership and valuation.\nAt the same time, within our wealth management business, our affiliated advisors focus on delivering disciplined financial advice, and long-term personal financial planning is as valuable as ever in helping clients achieve their financial goals. For our enterprise as a whole, across the changing circumstances, our shift to a remote work environment has not altered the comprehensive capability of our teams or the quality of service we are delivering to clients and our wealth management affiliated advisors.\nOur COVID-19 steering committee and enterprise preparedness teams continue to meet regularly to effectively navigate these unique times and evaluate options for returning safely to the workplace over time. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we have taken a holistic approach to managing through this environment with all stakeholders in mind; our clients, affiliated advisors, employees, shareholders and our community. Regardless of circumstances or environment, we are committed to steadily executing on our long-term vision and growth strategy.\nAs a reminder, that strategy consists of six key strategic enablers: Competitive products and pricing, continued focus on strong core processes and performance metrics, the ability to leverage technology and analytics as a strategic asset across the organization, having a growth culture and a more agile organization, sharpening our brand awareness in the marketplace and finally, effectively allocating capital through internal investment initiatives as well as taking advantage of potential dislocations and acquisition opportunities in the asset management and wealth management industries.\nI'd like to highlight some of the major steps we took over the quarter on these key focus areas. Within product and pricing, we supported clients by introducing new products in both businesses. In our asset management business, we introduced two additional strategies in our model delivery format, bringing our total offering to 9. These strategies are available in third-party retail, separately managed accounts and unified managed accounts.\nWe believe the opportunity in this space going forward is strong as wealth managers and financial professionals increasingly turn to model delivery because it provides them greater flexibility in vehicles as they provide financial plans for their clients. 76% of our assets under management are now priced at or below their respective peer median after the fee reductions that went into effect this quarter on our core bond and Large Cap Growth products as well as finalizing the closure of certain legacy unused share classes.\nIn our wealth management business, we introduced a high net worth suite of products and services designed to meet the needs of more affluent clients, while enabling affiliated advisors to offer a holistic, flexible approach to complex financial situations. We also introduced new separately managed account strategies in partnership with a range of institutional money managers, allowing affiliated advisors to offer the direct ownership, structure, transparency, tech strategy options and other benefits of SMAs to clients who may benefit. Within technology and analytics, we have filled the newly created position of Chief Analytics Officer.\nThis role will spearhead our efforts across the enterprise focused on our enterprisewide data analytics and artificial intelligence initiatives. We have also continued with our wealth management and asset management technology platform initiatives with the goal of improving our affiliated advisor and client experiences, enhancing sales enablement and improving internal operations. Lastly, we implemented additional digital and technology capabilities for our employees throughout the quarter for continued operational productivity and efficiency, while we navigate the work-from-home environment. We also made progress enhancing core processes and operating performance during the quarter.\nIn our asset management, and in our asset manager, we strengthened our institutional distribution model by launching new technology to create a more seamless client experience to support our continued progress in reducing AUM redemptions. In our wealth manager, we implemented a remote recruiting process that allowed us to maintain advisor recruiting activities despite the challenges associated with COVID-19. We expect these innovations will benefit our recruiting efforts even in a more normal environment, as we are able to leverage technology to more nimbly and quickly evaluate candidates in our strong pipeline.\nOur entire wealth management team also did an extraordinary job converting our annual vision conference to a virtual format under challenging circumstances. Our annual conference has been part of our culture for more than 50 consecutive years, and we did not want to let this year's plans for shared content and experiences be diminished due to the pandemic. Our team was able to quickly pivot to leverage technology-enabled solutions and create an interactive virtual 2-day experience that was attended by nearly 1,500 advisors, partners and home-office staff. In an effort to further drive our growth culture and organizational agility, we took additional actions to advance our diversity and inclusion initiatives.\nWe have made great strides to ensure we have a true culture of belonging within our organization. However, especially with recent events across the country over the past few months, we also know that we, as a society, an industry and a company, need to do more moving forward. Additional actions and steps we have recently completed and\/or announced include conducting additional all employee learning session, called Days of Understanding, focused on racial diversity and justice. These sessions include guest speakers from our local communities. Also, beginning in 2021, we will observe June 10 each year as a paid company holiday. This will provide our employees the opportunity... [Technical Issues]\nOperator\nPardon me. This is the conference operator. We appear to have lost Mr. Sander's location. If someone else would like to pick up, or I can put the call back on hold? Your choice.\nBenjamin R. Clouse -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI'll continue on. It's Ben. Apologize for the interruption, everyone. I'll pick up where Phil left off, and hopefully, he will join us. As we progress into 2020 and 2021, we will hire two newly created roles, entirely dedicated to diversity and inclusion. First, a Head of Diversity and Inclusion, responsible for developing and delivering on the next evolution of our comprehensive diversity and inclusion strategy that is aligned with our purpose, vision, mission, values and business goals across the organization. The second role will focus on diversity outreach and sourcing.\nThey will work across the organization to enhance our community and industry diversity outreach and sourcing efforts, including the diversity of candidate pools for employment and affiliated advisors as well as minority and women-owned vendors and business partners. In addition to the COVID-19-related donations we made earlier this year, we have recently provided support to organizations to help focus on racial justice and diversity and better support our local underserved communities. With respect to brand, we have launched a full brand review that will include all three of our brands across the enterprise.\nThis is a multiyear effort, and we launched the first phase of this initiative in the second quarter and are partnering with a premier, well-respected global brand agency on this phase of the project. Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, our balance sheet enables us to maintain a regular capital return to shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks, while also positioning us to pursue and finance strategic M&A if opportunities arise. In support of these efforts, we announced during the quarter that we have filled a newly created position of Vice President, Acquisition, Strategy and Integration.\nWe have been clear that inorganic growth is a key component of our strategy, and this position will play a vital role as we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities across wealth management and asset management. All of this progress highlights just some of the ongoing work we are continuing to deliver on our long-term vision and growth strategy. We continue to see evidence of progress across the enterprise and believe that our strategic positioning, our robust capital position, and most importantly, the resilience and adaptability of our people positions us well for growth in the future. Turning to a few details within both our asset management and wealth management businesses now.\nInvestments net flows improved this quarter, aided by meaningfully lower redemptions against our $2 billion in gross sales. In fact, redemptions improved 24% compared to the first quarter and 19% compared to the same quarter in 2019. Sales continued to be strong in our Mid-Cap suite with both, strategies and net positive flow for the quarter. While short-term performance has improved, we continue to see outflows in our international core strategy. Our distribution teams are working well remotely and continue to make traction across channels since we realigned the structure of our sales teams.\nWe continue to focus on providing our clients with high-quality service that meets their unique needs as well as highlight and provide access to our intellectual capital while keeping the safety and wellness of our employees and clients as our top priority. Turning to investment performance. Second quarter of this year was one of the best quarters for U.S. equities since 1998. The catalyst for the strong quarter was the resurgence in risk appetite in the market, following the securities repurchase securities purchase programs announced by the Fed, March 23, which marked the bottom in the first quarter sell off.\nEquity markets, in particular, were driven by low-quality factors, which, over the long term, have proven to be detrimental to compounded returns. Our commitment to institutional caliber processes means that while we are mindful of short-term market dynamics, we remain focused on the long-term and maintain discipline and consistency in volatile times such as we have seen in the first half of the year. While absolute returns were strong, active managers generally did not keep pace with benchmarks in the second quarter. We maintained strong long-term relative performance across our quality-oriented growth franchises, owing to our long-term commitment to finding and investing in companies with differentiated long-term growth prospects.\nOur international core equity strategy, which, as we have previously noted, has been challenged by negative flows, has more recently seen its relative value discipline results in improved investment performance. We continue to focus on delivering long-term success and communicate our discipline to our clients through our fundamental research and insights as we have through many market cycles. As we consistently enhanced our institutional caliber investment and distribution capabilities, our near-term focus will be on driving sales across a wide breadth of distribution opportunities while sustaining long-term performance improvement.\nTurning to the wealth management business. It has held true to form this year as a consistent and stable aspect of our enterprise that individuals, families and businesses continue to find value in personal financial planning guidance from professional advisors. As we've shared in the past, the wealth management business is a key driver to our long-term vision and growth strategy. We've seen strong advisor recruiting results this year. And we think our differentiated service and support model, combined with our technology package and full product suite, are resonating with these newly added advisors as well as other advisors in our recruiting pipeline.\nWe also have been pleased to see continued strong growth in advisory assets, with the sixth straight quarter of positive net advisory flows. The fact that these inflows occurred despite a challenging market backdrop, illustrates the wealth managers' ability to capture assets through market cycles. On the technology front, we further expanded our WaddellONE centralized digital data platform by introducing a comprehensive web-based and cloud-accessible integrated database, along with additional repository of processes, procedures and other information, both of which are now available to all affiliated financial advisors. Now I'll turn to financial results.\nWe reported net income of $25 million or $0.38 per share compared to $22 million or $0.32 per share in the prior quarter. As was expected, revenues dropped due to the sharp decrease in asset levels as we headed into the second quarter. Lower operating expenses partially offset the lower revenue and were $7.9 million better, while investment income improved $22.9 million due to unrealized investment gains on our corporate and seed investment portfolios, net of our hedging strategy. Wealth management assets under administration ended the quarter at $59 billion and increased 14% compared to the prior quarter primarily due to the market rebound.\nNet new assets improved compared to the first quarter, partially from stronger advisory sales as well as lower brokerage account redemptions. As you saw in the release, we've updated our definition of net new assets to include dividends and interest, which aligns with how others in the industry report this metric versus including it in market action. We have included a schedule presenting the historical data on our IR website, so you can see the impact of this change. Notwithstanding the updated net new assets definition, this quarter continued a multi-quarter growth trend in net new advisory assets with 3.3% annualized growth and an all-time high balance of $27.2 billion in advisory assets at quarter end. Our progress transforming the wealth management business continued in the quarter, and we were pleased to have another 11 advisors affiliate with the firm.\nAs you know, we just recently reinvigorated active recruiting efforts, and we've been pleased with the progress thus far in the year despite the challenges that remote recruiting brings. Since the beginning of the year, 21 advisors have affiliated with Waddell & Reed with combined prior firm assets under administration totaling over $1.4 billion. This strong recruiting, combined with continued low attrition, resulted in the advisor count inflecting modestly this quarter and stabilizing at 1,317 affiliated advisors and associates at June 30. Adviser productivity remained consistent as well at an average of over $460,000 in total gross revenue.\nWe believe our differentiated service and support model, combined with our technology package and full product suite are resonating with these newly added advisors, advisors in our recruiting pipeline and our legacy advisors. Ivy Investments under management ended the quarter at $65 billion, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter, while average assets under management of $61.7 billion were down 7%. I would only add to the detail on flows earlier in the call that we've been encouraged with the steady continuous improvement in flows. And while it's still early, the potential of our redefined sales strategy has thus far proven worthwhile.\nTurning to the financial results. Total revenue for the quarter was $240 million and decreased compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the lower asset levels. Investment management fees were also lower due to a lower effective management fee rate, resulting from mix shifts as well as the targeted fee reductions implemented in the quarter on our Large Cap Growth and core bond products. U&D fees were lower as well due to lower advisory fees and service and distribution fees due to lower asset levels. In addition, sales commissions were lower $5.7 million as a result of reduced sales activity across insurance product lines. Operating expenses totaled $216.4 million and decreased $7.9 million compared to the prior quarter.\nDistribution costs were lower $12.2 million due to the lower revenues, while controllable costs increased $4.9 million due to higher compensation, G&A and technology costs. Compensation increased as a result of the mark-to-market increases on equity compensation and our deferred compensation plan, both due to the market rebound. G&A expenses were higher $1.9 million, as we redeployed travel and entertainment savings into strategic initiatives across the organization. Technology costs also increased due to new software solutions deployed during the year.\nWhile we did take several incremental actions to reduce controllable expenses through the first six months of the year, we were clear in our last earnings call that we would continue to take a long-term view and invest in the areas we think will allow us to come out of the pandemic in a strong position and drive our long-term growth strategy. While we will continue to closely monitor expenses for opportunities to drive additional efficiencies, we do expect the controllable expense run rate to return to our prior guided range of $105 million to $106 million per quarter for the remainder of this year, primarily related to continued strategic project investments but, of course, subject to the broader market environment.\nThe effective income tax rate was 25.3% for the quarter and was lower due to volatility of forecasted earnings, despite including discrete tax expense of $1.3 million related to shortfalls from the vesting of restricted shares. Based on current asset levels and the resulting forecast, we expect the tax rate to be at the high end of our prior guided range of 24% to 26% for the balance of the year. Cash and investment balances increased modestly compared to the prior quarter due to unrealized gains on the investment portfolio as well as operating cash flows which were partially offset by share repurchases and dividends.\nWe continue to be pleased with the strength of the balance sheet as we execute on our organic growth plans, while maintaining the flexibility to pursue inorganic opportunities, all while maintaining an active shareholder capital return program. Finally, we completed the settlement of our pension plan, which removes a $194 million gross liability from the firm.\nWe viewed this action as a win for both the company from a reduced cost of recordkeeping and compliance perspective as well as for participants who are able to access their balances and direct them in accordance with their overall retirement plan. We still maintain a competitive defined contribution plan, which we enhanced as part of this transition to include a discretionary company contribution component in addition to the matching component.\nOperator, we would now like to open the call for questions, and I'm told that Phil has rejoined us.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr -- Evercore -- Analyst\nOkay. So I want to ask a question on your hiring of the executive on the M&A front. We've seen a little bit of a pickup in activity lately in the industry. So curious what you're seeing overall? I see and then for you, specifically, with the balance sheet stronger, I'm curious on how you balance the healthy tension of wanting to probably buy something that's in favor, higher fees and inflowing, but the higher valuations that come with that and your willingness to do so in this market, please?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Thanks, Glenn. This is Phil. My apologies for dropping off earlier, and thanks to Ben for taking over. I guess this is highlights the challenges of working from home at different times. But I'd say maybe I'll start, and Ben, I don't know if you want to add on this. I think as the market has rebounded, there's been a little bit more activity in terms of it filing a little bit. And obviously, this we've made no secret of the fact that over time, as we've kind of transformed the business model along with our strong capital position, we have the ability to jump-start our growth through acquisition opportunities or strategic investments and that type of thing.\nI think, as you said, it will be I think on the asset manager side, it would likely be more specific with specific strategies or relatively focused areas that can augment existing strengths or broaden our portfolio. As you said, either uncorrelated asset classes that we don't currently provide or excel. I think within the fixed income area, that's not been a huge area of expertise for our company. Historically, we've been more equity-minded. So I think there's opportunities on the margin to be active there. I do think acquisitions in the asset management area do present some specific challenges with respect to culture and integration, and we want to certainly be mindful of that.\nI would also say that on the wealth management side, I think that is also an area that we're very interested in. We've made significant progress in transforming the business model within our wealth management transition to an open architecture platform. As you've seen in the recent results, we've now really made a significant improvement with respect to the stabilizing the advisor count. And we're optimistic that we can grow that business going forward. So there's opportunities to scale that part of our company as well, which I think would be a long-term stabilizer to the overall business model.\nAnd then finally, I would just say, obviously, share buybacks remain an area of focus as well. And we can be opportunistic there. So I'd say in this environment, it's a good we have real strength in our balance sheet, in the financial profile, and it provides us a lot of opportunity to be flexible and take advantage of potential dislocations in this industry. So I might stop there. Ben, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add in terms of how we see that.\nBenjamin R. Clouse -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI think that was well said, Phil. I would add one thing, which is we're very pleased to have Charles join us, who will be focused, in particular, on M&A opportunities. And his addition as well as that focus is part of our continued strategic plan like we have laid out. So we are just marching forward in that respect.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. And Dan, I think you wanted to make one point.\nDaniel P. Hanson -- Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer\nYes. I'll just add a point, Glenn. And Glenn, you rightly point out, there are areas in the market that are hot. They're going to trade at higher valuations. The equally interesting part of that equation is there are other areas of the market where the market has a less demanding view of it because, in some cases, potentially a short-term dislocation challenges and whatnot, and that can very well be an opportunity. So the attitude we take is, is there a strategic fit with our investment capability within the asset management M&A rubric?\nDoes it advance our core who we are as Ivy as fundamental active investors as an institutional caliber platform. Can we complement and advance that core identity through our inorganic levers? And if so, valuation clearly is a part of all of that. But just as there are hot areas in the market, there is areas to add value by taking a longer view.\nGlenn Schorr -- Evercore -- Analyst\nThanks so much.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon -- Jefferies and Company -- Analyst\nThanks. So I just wanted to talk about the advisor backlog and kind of the outlook for advisor growth. And if you could just talk about where that sits today. And I know you mentioned recruiting is getting a little bit easier, but also talk about the typical profile of the advisor that's coming on your platform, year-to-date, the 21, I think, new advisors you've added?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Shawn, do you want to take that one?\nShawn M. Mihal -- Senior Vice President and Wealth Management\nYes. Thanks, Phil. And Dan, thanks for your question. We're continuing to see even in midst of the COVID-19 impacts and the pandemic and having to do some alternate-type approaches with regard to recruiting virtually. We're still seeing a strong pipeline that's coming through the organization. We're actually we look at the overall background and the typical profile. Our average recruiting has been right about that $400,000. And when we take the 21 advisors for the 2020 year average productivity is about $390,000. So consistent with that target that we laid out there. We're trying to recruit toward that more high-producing-type advisor targeting around $400,000 in production.\nWith that, we're seeing a relatively diverse background coming from a variety of different firms, independent banks, some wire house as well as the RIA channel. So a relatively diverse group that's coming into the organization, but consistent with what our value proposition has been, which has been focused on the build-out of our competitive technology package, but more about the overarching support model that we've been providing to our advisors with detailed practice development services, advanced sales, diamond service support, things of that nature that have really driven the experience with those advisors.\nSo we're seeing quite a bit of background there that's driving that competitiveness around a multitude of different aspects and advisors that are coming into the organization. Again, the pipeline is remaining strong for us. We've seen five advisors on board in the month of July here with bringing in assets in that range of about $1.5 million prior firm trailing TGR, total gross revenue. So the pipeline is remaining active, and we're working through some of the complexities related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDan Fannon -- Jefferies and Company -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Carrier -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nMaybe first one, just on the net flows. Still in the unaffiliated channel, you guys saw a good improvement. We can see the trend in terms of the lower redemptions, still were fairly steady. But anything particularly driving that just in terms of like certain products or certain platforms you noticed like a significant change? Obviously, like industry trends got better, but just wanted to see if there was anything specific for Waddell.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nAmy, do you want to touch on that?\nAmy J. Scupham -- Senior Vice President and Distribution\nYes. Good morning, everybody. And thanks, Mike, for the question. I would say you're right. The industry flows just generally got better, especially as it related to redemptions. But when we look at it product by product, with the Phil mentioned in his script of the improving short-term performance of international core, which is with the relative value strategy coming back in favor. And we saw some decreased redemptions in that strategy. That was a big driver, but we really thought across the board and more heavily in the strategies where we focus our sales efforts. So it really was across the board, but led by international core.\nMike Carrier -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay. And then just a quick follow-up. So on the fee rate, you guys mentioned the price changes and for everyone, the mix this quarter created a lot of volatility. I don't know if you can parse that out in terms of the impact, but just trying to get a sense of what's more normal just given the pretty significant move in the quarter?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nI don't know Ben, do you want to take that?\nBenjamin R. Clouse -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. I would be happy to. Yes, a piece of that, of course, were the new fee waivers that we added on Large Cap Growth and core bond. And again, we expect those to have an annualized impact of $0.01 to $0.02. So of course, the quarter was a proportional piece of those. The other thing going on there was mix, in particular, ICE, or international core equity, flows, as Amy alluded, that shifted our fee rate a little bit. And then we are, as are many others, making up some of the rate on money markets just due to the low rate environment, that also had a very small impact in the quarter.\nMike Carrier -- Bank of America -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks a lot.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nBill Katz -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you very much for taking the questions. So just coming back to your distribution margin a little bit. Appreciate there's probably some moving parts in that quarter-to-quarter. But it does look like it sort of squeezed down a little bit in terms of profitability. Could you talk a little bit about what might be driving that? Is there any sort of unusual items in there? Is that sort of the right way to be thinking about it looking ahead?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Ben, you want to take a crack at that?\nBenjamin R. Clouse -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think part of that, of course, were lower asset levels, in particular, starting at the beginning of the period, which probably had the most significant impact on both wealth and asset management. As a reminder, most of our advisory assets in the wealth business are billed at first of the month based on asset levels. And so some of that is just the way the calculations work. And movement, of course, during the quarter was quite significant and, as you well know. We also had a little bit of a decline in sales in insurance products, again, in the wealth business that we mentioned in our comments that were contributing to that.\nBill Katz -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful. And then just as I think about the pipeline you had mentioned is pretty good. When you can you talk a little bit about which segments within the wealth management business that you're really seeing the greatest opportunity set right now?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Bill, are you referencing potential M&A opportunities or that type of thing?\nBenjamin R. Clouse -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, sure. It was actually more of an organic argument, but I didn't want to double down the inorganic question. But if you want to answer it that way too, I would be certainly open to your views.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Well, Shawn, why don't you talk about what you're seeing in terms of on the recruiting front and the opportunities to add to our advisor count over time?\nShawn M. Mihal -- Senior Vice President and Wealth Management\nYes. The pipeline we've been working has been relatively fluid for us. When we look really across the segment, most predominantly it's the other independent channels, so other independent firms where we're seeing most inflows of advisors coming into the what on reorganization. And I think what's resonating there is really the overarching package that we've assembled here, a competitive technology, payout grids, overarching product and open architecture, development on our advisory programs that we've been working on for the past several quarters, but it's really resonating around additional support models with advanced sales support through our Wealth Solutions Group, the materiality of our practice development team as well as field support that we have embedded out there.\nWe've done a lot over the course of 2020 to still maintain service levels and support models in light of COVID-19, evaluating the situation and doing a variety of different types virtual opportunities, including the migration of our in-person conference to a virtual-based conference that had a lot of success associated with it. So all of those things are resonating with advisors and promoting that opportunity to organically grow the organization with obviously seeing the inflection point modestly here this past quarter with an uptick in advisor headcount, just a modest uptake.\nBut it's the first head count increase since the fourth quarter of 2015. So a lot of the work that's been done over the last several quarters and couple of years to really drive to the competitiveness of the firm is resonating and what we're seeing from those other independent firms is either coming from larger firms where the support isn't as robust with regard to that more dedicated type of support that I mentioned through the various different personnel services, where we can compete, obviously, the technology and payout grids and things like that, but really giving that to those advisors that are not getting that type of support at larger firms, or at the lower smaller firms, having the opportunity to provide those overarching competitive packages with the support programs that I mentioned is really what's driving that. And maybe I'll refer back over to Phil and Ben on the inorganic M&A side.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Thanks, Shawn. Ben, did you want to make a point there?\nBenjamin R. Clouse -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Bill. I would add to Shawn's comments just from a product perspective in addition to the points Shawn made in regard to advisors. We're certainly focused on our advisory suite of products, which, as you know, we've expanded and grown. And as you heard in the comments, we are very pleased with the asset growth there. On the M&A side, just adding to Phil's earlier comments in the wealth business, it's really about driving more scale. So we believe we have a best-in-class grid. We are in the process of building out our technology to also be best-in-class and have made a huge amount of progress there. But believe we now have the infrastructure in place to support greater scale, more advisors with the platform that we've put together.\nBill Katz -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nGreat. It's helpful. If I know I'm violating the code here, but can I just squeeze one more question in? Just I appreciate that your flows have gotten better sequentially. But when you look month-to-month, like June was a little bit of a step back month on the retail side. Can you maybe talk a little bit what might have happened there despite sort of very elevated retail engagement just more broadly? And then how are things looking into July?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nAmy, do you want to take that?\nAmy J. Scupham -- Senior Vice President and Distribution\nSure. Sure. Yes. So Bill, we did see a little bit of a step back in June. It was actually more of an increase in redemptions in that month than it was a decrease in sales. When you look at July, you're seeing, I guess, trends on par with June, maybe slightly better due to better redemptions. But I think what we're seeing is a little bit of seasonality just going into the summertime months. Second quarter is generally one of our second best quarters of the year. And so the third is typically the worst. So we're seeing we're seeing a little bit of seasonality.\nAnd then we've also seen that return to fixed income, heavy fixed income flow, especially across the intermediary marketplace. And then I would say, just to add a little bit more to that, Bill, for some context. When you look across our institutional channel, as we know, it's a lumpy channel that can have big inflow, big outflow. We've had two consecutive quarters of no client losses and continue to see the pipeline growing there.\nAnd I think that's an important point to make because from a long-term flow perspective, you have a lot of institutional overlay in the intermediary and retail marketplace. And we've had some positive markers of success with some of those gatekeepers on that side of the business. And during the quarter, had two semifinals and one final presentation. So definitely progress on that side of the business as well, which will help the overall flow profile.\nBill Katz -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks for answering all the questions this morning.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about profitability, about 10% operating margin in the quarter here, down from around 15% or so where I think you've been operating for a number of quarters. Arguably, this current quarter impacted by the lower average AUM level. So I guess is there a minimum level of profitability that you're kind of keeping in mind here that you're managing the business too and a floor, if you will, and if it falls below which you'd consider more strategic changes. So just curious how you're thinking about that? And as you look out over the next couple of years, what's the right level of operating margin or pre-tax margin for Waddell over the next couple of years? How are you thinking about that?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Ben, do you want to address that? Is Ben on the line?\nOperator\nMr. Clouse is still connected, perhaps he muted his phone?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nMaybe I'll just at a high level, Michael, I'd say I think with respect to the short-term volatility and profitability, I would say, I think we've been pretty clear. We're managing the company for the longer-term. And the strength of the balance sheet and the financials allow us to kind of make the strategic investments we need to do to kind of get us where we need to be over the long term. So we're not going to overreact to short-term volatility in the market.\nAnd a lot of as you pointed out, a lot of that profitability metric was influenced by asset levels and that type of thing. But as we move forward, we think that will operate over time. We have a long-term opportunity here in terms of strengthening the profitability and the wealth management aspect of our business, and we'll get to more competitive levels with respect to the enterprise over time. Let me see if Ben is back on. Ben, are you back on?\nI don't know. I think he is trying to get back on, Michael. So maybe we'll go to the next question and have him circle back and when he reconnects and we can come back to that question.\nMichael Cyprys -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes. Sure. And I'm happy to follow up off-line as well. Maybe just a quick follow-up on some of the retail distribution initiatives, some of the new vehicles that you're bringing to the marketplace on SMA model delivery. Just curious how you're thinking about the opportunity set there? How much is that contributing, would you say, today to AUM and flows? And as you look out, what are sort of the next things on your to-do list there?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I think, Amy...\nAmy J. Scupham -- Senior Vice President and Distribution\nYes. Mike, this is oh sorry, Phil.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. No. Go ahead, Amy.\nAmy J. Scupham -- Senior Vice President and Distribution\nYes. So as it relates to the model delivery or SMA portfolios today, it's contributing very little to the overall flow in AUM picture. You'll recall that we launched the first seven model delivery portfolios last May. So just a little bit over a year ago. We've seen some pretty good progress on the RIA side of the business and getting a couple of additional model placements and opportunities, which have a huge opportunity to drive flows. So I'll give an example. One of the contracts that we signed last quarter is on a model provider that has over 100 bank trusts that utilize that platform. So the ability to drive flow that direction is going to be fairly substantial.\nThe work that we're still in the midst of is working with our broker-dealer distribution partners for placement there. And the point of that is to be able to offer the flexibility of vehicles to their advisor basis based on whatever program they might be in and model delivery is certainly one of those, especially when you look across the domestic equity asset class. I think from a product development standpoint, we focus in we're kind of focused in a couple of areas.\nCertainly, we're taking a look at the ETF structures, whether it's fully transparent or semi-transparent. It's still a discussion and a decision for us to make. But making sure that we're paying attention to the newer vehicles out there in the marketplace that might be garnering flow. And then when you partner that with potential our current active capabilities that we have in incubator portfolios or potential acquisition or talent addition in other spaces could certainly add ability for us to launch a series of ETFs as well.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Thanks, Amy. Michael, we do have Ben back on the line. So I might just ask him to add any question any perspective with respect to your question on the short-term dip in profitability given the market sell off.\nBenjamin R. Clouse -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Sorry about that, Michael, about the technical difficulty. I apologize, I didn't hear the answer. I would just give here would be my context. As a reminder, we operate two lines of business, asset management and wealth. So of course, you're looking at a blended margin. As we talked about before, we have a number of initiatives that we're pursuing to drive margin improvement. I don't think we clearly have any particular floor. And as we talked about in the first quarter, we identified a number of savings initiatives or things to enhance the margin. But at the same time, we're very much focused on the long-term and investments we continue to make in our business. And we are very much aligned as a management team and with our Board on that. So I apologize if that's duplicative, but hopefully, that helps.\nMichael Cyprys -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you so much. Appreciate the color.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRobert Lee -- KBW -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question is just on comments around expense and the guided, the controllable expense guidance in the next couple of quarters. Just trying to get a feel for do you think beyond the next couple of quarters into next year, understanding that you're in the process of moving headquarters, obviously, even investments to make. So is there any piece of that, that you feel like spend technology spend or otherwise, and we maybe start to see ease or fall off as we kind of move into 2021 at this point? Or are you or is there or is this really kind of at least right now, kind of thinking about good run rates as kind of normal inflation growth from here?\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Thanks for the question, Robert. Ben, do you want to address that?\nBenjamin R. Clouse -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Robert, obviously, the farther out we look, the less precise we can be. I agree with your promise that inflation is a good proxy for expense growth. Of course, we will continue to look to offset that through efficiency efforts. In regard to the technology spend, I referenced, and the investments we're making there. That will continue into 2021, at least for the first part of 2021, in particular, to our wealth management business.\nSome of those technology investments are in areas of workflow and onboarding and things we're doing to drive a better advisor and client experience that will result in some efficiencies ultimately once fully implemented. I would also remind you of our ongoing real estate transition, which we will largely have concluded by the end of this year that will also drive some margin improvement for us into 2021.\nRobert Lee -- KBW -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. And maybe a follow-up, just in the wealth management business. Can you maybe update us on how Waddell audits preparing kind of in the sales mix. So for example, our just observation kind of seems like convention rate to tell. Then there but maybe sales in the wealth management channel of Ivy products have moderated. So are you seeing just even existing advisors just allocate more and more lending to the third-party products? And when you bring in a new advisor, what's kind of your expectation over time as it relates to their ability to sell more Waddell product deal that is kind of your breakeven analysis.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Shawn, do you want to take a crack at that one?\nShawn M. Mihal -- Senior Vice President and Wealth Management\nYes. I'll maybe start it off and certainly, Ben and\/or others, Amy may want to comment as well. And when we look at this with regard to just inside the wealth management business, our overall ratio of affiliated funds was at about 64.8%. The prior quarter was about 64.3%. So not much change between the quarters. But when we look back a little further, the ratios at this time last year was about 67.6%. So what we're really seeing is with regard to new sales going forward as we've opened the architecture is that new sales are going into a broader product set. So with existing advisors, legacy advisors as well as new advisors that are joining the organization, having a broader product set means that the sales are going to a broader space of opportunities there.\nSo we do look at reasonably what those expectations are for sales of affiliated funds going forward. But we know that those sales are going to, on a new sales basis, continue to reduce in some regard with regard to the open architecture of the platform. So on that wealth management side, we do expect to see that, that rate continue to shift. As we've seen here over the course of the last year just based on primarily new sales going forward, there likely will be some minor migration of assets that we've seen over the course of the last time here. But at least new sales going forward to a broader products that will lead to a more dispersion in that affiliated fund product mix. And I might just turn it over to Ben or to Amy to talk about the Ivy side.\nAmy J. Scupham -- Senior Vice President and Distribution\nThis is Amy. I'll go ahead and make a couple of comments here. Yes, I would agree with everything that Shawn said as the advisors within the wealth manager have more selection across their advisory platform. In particular, we have a range of market share depending on which product that they're using. And so I would expect to see a continued mix shift of less unaffiliated or more unaffiliated funds being utilized inside of that base.\nHowever, as the wealth manager continues to grow and recruit new advisors, potential acquisitions, we do have the ability to compete inside of that advisor base as well. My expectation would be that we would that it looks very similar to what it does in our unaffiliated partners where your more competitive product can bring in up to tend to 10% to 15% market share in a fully open architecture, and it would move down from there. So it would just really be dependent on which product they're using inside of the wealth manager and then the competitiveness of our individual strategies within that.\nShawn M. Mihal -- Senior Vice President and Wealth Management\nOne last point I would add on that, which we've seen a bit of already. But certainly, over the longer term, our wealth management business provides greater balance and stability to our overall firm revenue as those assets are more resilient during periods of volatility and the and the work we've done in transitioning the business model and wealth has certainly helped those dynamics. So that's another aspect of that as well.\nRobert Lee -- KBW -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Phil Sanders for any closing remarks.\nPhilip J. Sanders -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Thank you. Appreciate everybody joining us. And my apologies again for the technical difficulties at the start of the call. But as you can see, we've undergone quite a bit of a business model transformation over the last couple of years.\nBut given our strong capital position, really feel comfortable with the state of the world these days with respect to our model and how it's evolved, and our ability to invest in continuing to build out our institutional caliber asset manager as well as now be positioned to really grow the wealth manager over time and the power of that business model through the combination of both an asset manager and a wealth manager supported by shared services functions really is quite unique in the industry and one that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of our ability to grow in the future. So with that, I will conclude. And just, again, thanks, everybody, and have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\nDuration: 61 minutes\nCall participants:\nMichael J.

Smucker Company's fiscal 2022 first-quarter earnings question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Aaron Broholm, vice president, investor relations.\nPlease go ahead, sir.\nAaron Broholm -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 first-quarter earnings question-and-answer session. I hope everyone has had a chance to review our results as detailed in this morning's press release and management's prerecorded remarks, which are available on our corporate website at jmsmucker.com. Additionally, we will post an audio replay of this call at the conclusion of this morning's Q&A session.\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations about future plans and performance. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we use non-GAAP results to evaluate performance internally. I encourage you to read the full disclosure concerning forward-looking statements and details on our non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release.\nAvailable today on the call is Mark Smucker, president and chief executive officer; and Tucker Marshall, chief financial officer. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, please queue up the first question. \nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. The question-and-answer session will begin at this time. [Operator instructions] Our first question today is coming from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. I guess -- I'm sure there'll be plenty of discussion around inflation and cost and pricing and whatnot. So I'd like to focus a bit on your prepared remarks on the recovery of the Nutrish brand, which is lagging expectations.\nYou mentioned currently evaluating additional actions to better position the business. I guess, are you able to unpack that a bit more for us? Are we talking about further potential portfolio sort of optimization moves or repositioning the brand or its pricing position in the category or really something else entirely? I'm just trying to get a better handle on sort of why it's lagging and what actions are being contemplated? Thanks so much.\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Andrew. Thanks for the question. It's Mark Smucker.\u00a0\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning.\u00a0\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning. Let me just make a couple of very brief comments just about the business in general, and I will answer the Nutrish question. I just want to acknowledge, first of all, that we are very pleased with the results this quarter. It's our sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding expectations.\nIf you look at -- in the prepared remarks, and you back out some of the noise in terms of divestitures and really look at an apples-to-apples, the total company grew 1%. All of our U.S. businesses grew. And on a two-year stack, we saw that 6% top-line growth.\nSo the point here is that underlying business fundamentals remain strong, demand is still there. Our investments almost across every part of our business are working. Our brands are strong. I mean, just looking at the share growth, two-thirds of our portfolio are growing.\nA couple of years ago, that was like a quarter of our brands were growing. So we are very pleased with the progress and the way we've been able to execute throughout the last -- particularly the last 18 months in the pandemic. And so really one of the only spots where we have not been satisfied is on Nutrish dry dog. Even the pet business itself grew in line with our algorithm.\nIf you look on a two-year stack, it's about a 3% growth. And we've said our algorithm is 3% to 4%. So we have been meeting that and seeing growth in dog snacks and cat food, etc. So really, we're isolated to Nutrish dry dog.\nWe do remain committed to the brand. We have continued our portfolio and packaging optimizations. We are -- it's still at the early stages of the Big Life launch. So we clearly believe that there is still potential for the brand.\nSpecifically, though, we have not been satisfied with some of our marketing investments and feel that they have not delivered the requisite return. And so we are actually pulling back on some of those marketing investments, still supporting the master brand and Big Life, but making sure that the dollars we're spending there are truly going to make a difference, and we're going to pull back temporarily and reevaluate some of those investments. And so that's why we said the full recovery of the Nutrish brand will be delayed throughout the remainder of this fiscal year.\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nRight. Thank you for that. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Goldman from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks so much. I wanted to just dig in a little bit. One of the questions we're getting this morning is, not only on the first quarter but on the second quarter, the timing of shipments versus what we saw at Nielsen or really just takeaway overall beyond Nielsen as well.\nFirst, was there any mismatch between those two in the quarter just reported? And then does your outlook for the second quarter include any assumption that maybe some of your customers will buy a little bit ahead of some announced price increases? Thank you.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nKen, as it relates to first-quarter shipments, the first quarter from a big-picture perspective came in line with expectations. But we did have two areas that were a bit softer than anticipated. One, due to labor and transportation issues throughout the entire network, there were some shipments left on the dock that occurred at the end of July that should pick up into August. And secondly, due to some specific situations with two e-commerce retailers, e-comm in the quarter was a little bit softer.\nSo we would anticipate in the second quarter and beyond shipments to recover and then also a bit of return in the e-commerce channel.\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK, great. That's helpful. And then just quickly to follow up on something. I appreciate you don't buy forward or hedge everything out.\nYou may still have some exposure to spot markets each quarter. But I'm a little surprised why the near-term headwind is this much worse, right, in particular, for 2Q. So is there any way to help us order or size some of the incremental cost challenges, right, whether it's direct inputs for food stocks or packaging or labor? Just so we better understand a little bit what's hitting you harder than you initially thought.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nKen, as we came into the fiscal year, we were anticipating mid-single-digit cost inflation as a percent of our total cost of goods sold. Now we're seeing high single-digit cost inflation as a percentage of our total cost of goods sold. The change from our initial expectation is really driven within our commodity ingredients area, transportation, and then packaging. And when you think of commodity ingredients, there have been a few factors that have been driving that.\nOne is weather-related, so that would impact coffee, particularly with Brazil weather patterns. The second was also weather patterns in the West, specifically the Pacific Northwest that impacted fruit. So those are two areas of commodities or ingredients where we've seen inflation come through, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year. Transportation, due to the volatility and tightness of supply chain, continues to be real not only from a labor standpoint but also from a unit standpoint, and just an overall sort of backlog in the system that has persisted throughout the entire pandemic.\nAnd then on the packaging front, packaging continues to have the implications of just ongoing pricing pressures that continue candidly from the weather disruption that occurred in the winter time frame in Texas due to the freeze. And so as a result of this persistent inflation, we continue to manage through very effectively, not only through our supply chain and relationships with our suppliers and the great work by our teams, but we've got to acknowledge this inflation in our P&L and we need to recover it. And we are going to recover it through additional pricing actions this fiscal year that we anticipate in the second and third quarters in order to recover that. So we do believe this is a timing impact.\nAnd as a result of the timing impact, it should have pressure on the margin that we noted as well. But I do want to acknowledge two things. We remain confident in the way we've executed throughout the entire pandemic, and we will going forward. And I also want to acknowledge that this is not a symptom-specific to Smucker.\nCandidly, this is a symptom-specific to the entire economy.\nKen Goldman -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you very much.\u00a0\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Growe from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nI just had a quick question to follow up on some of the supply chain issues and kind of the labor-related issues. I guess I want to understand the degree to which those are an incremental factor in the lower gross margin outlook in relation to the inflation, is there one that's more than the other? Just how to frame those two in relation to the gross margin softness you're going to see relative to your previous guidance?\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nChris, definitely, there are two factors that are driving the inflationary environment for us. One is just the underlying input commodity and ingredient. The second is transportation, as you have noted. And that has been a persistent headwind not only last fiscal year, but it continues to be one this fiscal year.\nAnd again, it is predominantly driven by the availability of labor and it's also driven, to some extent, by the capacity of the system. And so that's what we continue to manage through. We have been very successful in managing not only our long-term contracts but also our spot rate contracts as well. We continue to do our best.\nBut as you bring material in, as you produce and you ship material out, the entire network right now is impacted from a transportation standpoint. And it is material.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nAnd so, Tucker, that transportation factor, is that half the gross margin decline? Is it that big? Or ingredient is a bigger factor? I'm just trying to get a relative size on how big each one could be?\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo. The commodity and ingredient would be the leading factor.\u00a0\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nOK.\u00a0\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nA very close secondary factor would be transportation and packaging if you're thinking in terms of order of magnitude.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nOK. And then just a follow-on to that. Is this something that you can price to? And I mean, from a high level, not looking at next quarter but just in general, do you view these costs as transitory? Or can you -- is there another round of pricing? Or are you adjusting your pricing increases to account for this incremental cost you're bearing?\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Chris. This is Mark. As we think about cost and pricing recovery, we really try to take a holistic view and make sure that, as we've said before, are working with our retail customers in a prudent and fair way to recover essentially the aggregate costs. And so when we look at costs and how they impact the finished product, we really look at that in totality.\nAnd as we go forward with our retail partners, just making sure that we have an open and transparent dialogue of what needs to happen so that we can indeed recover those costs through our entire tool kit, whether that's list price, net revenue optimization, or what have you.\nChris Growe -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks a lot.\u00a0\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nBryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGood morning, everyone.\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMorning.\u00a0\nBryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nSo I guess just a coffee -- or a question more specific to coffee and actually two. One is just it sounds like -- or maybe I want to clarify that even coffee costs in the quarter were running higher. And I guess the fact that it's going to hit you seemingly reasonably soon, does it suggest that just maybe your hedges were at the end? Or you weren't hedged out as long as you normally were? Just trying to understand the dynamic of green coffee costs have clearly moved, but it seems to be impacting you pretty quickly. And so just if you can kind of walk us through I guess how you were positioned or hedged for higher coffee costs.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nBryan, good morning. As it relates to our cost position for the year, as we said, coming into our fiscal year, we knew that we would have year-over-year cost inflation, which was inclusive of our coffee portfolio as well. And we knew that that inflation was going to begin to hit us on a 12-month basis and that we were taking initial pricing actions in July to begin to recover that initial wave of inflation. And so the margin in coffee for the quarter, but yet the margin for the entire business for the quarter does reflect that inflation ahead of the pricing recovery.\nAs you think about what's happened since our initial guidance, we began to have weather impacts in Brazil that began to affect the underlying commodity. And as a result of that, we've been managing through how we think about delivering the balance of the year. While we'd like to give you the specifics on our hedging position, we don't disclose that. But what we can share is, is that coffee costs have gone up and that we will take additional pricing actions and measures to ensure that we recover the inflationary impact that we're seeing to the P&L.\nBryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK. And then I guess to the extent that the weather has been part of the issue, is there also a -- I guess, a question or pressure around just availability of green coffees? Are you concerned at all about just supply of raw material?\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Bryan, it's Mark. Generally speaking, the frost in Brazil, which is what Tucker was referring to, over a longer period, over a 12-month period is going to have some impact on the amount of coffee that's available. However, as one of the -- we are the largest roaster in the U.S. and one of the larger roasters in the world.\nWe still would be able to get our needs met, but as Tucker referenced, it is going to be at higher prices, which we will continue to manage through our robust set of hedging tools. So we think we can manage through it, but just acknowledge that both just the Brazilian crop, as well as some of the ongoing transportation issues, are contributing to those costs.\nBryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK. And if I could just sneak one last one and just same topic on coffee. Just maybe if you can give us, Mark, some perspective on -- we've had other periods of time in coffee where there's been inflation and the industry has had to price it through and there's been some elasticity. Can you just maybe give us some context in terms of this current situation with costs rising and having to price it through and kind of where the consumer is? Do you expect like this to be an abnormal period in terms of prices going up and elasticity? Or is this a pretty normal sort of course of action for, again, a category that has that pass-through element?\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I guess the headline there would be that as we have managed through this initial phase of pricing, which is now in effect, the elasticities that we have modeled have generally performed as expected. We can't predict what green coffee is going to do over the long term in terms of costs, but we are certainly not at historical highs and so we would anticipate that as we think about further pricing actions and elasticity, that we should be able to manage through that. And even though no elasticity model is ever perfect, we do have confidence that we'll be able to manage through that in a realistic fashion.\nBryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nAll right. Thank you for the color.\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Your line is now live.\nAlexia Howard -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst\nGood morning, everyone.\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nMorning.\u00a0\nAlexia Howard -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst\nSo can we ask about the -- what the key drivers of uncertainty are, what the biggest risks are, I guess, over the next few quarters? It seems as though the level of uncertainty around -- particularly around supply chain disruption and perhaps the fragility of the supply chain has increased. That feels somewhat different from previous commodity cycles where it was literally just having to handle increased cost pressures and pricing through. Other companies are also saying it's actually physically quite hard at the moment to get products from whether it's ingredients from overseas or whether it's shipping domestically in the U.S. because of the trucking situation.\nI'm just wondering what you see as the biggest sort of pain points and risks that you're looking at over the next few quarters. What the biggest concerns are at the moment? Thank you, and I'll pass it on.\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAlexia, it's Mark. As we've discussed thus far, we've talked a lot about inflation and cost pressures, and that is of course the primary driver. And then the second one is supply chain, as you noted. I mean, if we really want to simplify, it's primarily those two factors.\nThere's a lot of unknowns, of course, about the pandemic and what course that may take, so we're watching that extremely carefully. But as to the supply chain, specifically, we do believe that the reason that we have had success is because of our ability to execute and manage the supply chain. There is no question that it is tight and there are a variety of issues, tightness spanning from all the way upstream to all the way to the shelf at the retailer. But I would submit that our team and our people have done such a good job of managing every single step of the way, engaging with suppliers and customers all the way through to the retail shelf that has been key to our success.\nAnd so much so that it has allowed us to actually gain distribution at shelf because we generally have been able to deliver to our customers. We've gained some space in recent shelf set resets because of our ability to execute. And so if you think about that factor coupled with our new commercial model, which is truly focused on the retail shelf and delivering, I think that really has been critical to how we've been able to deliver results thus far, and we would anticipate continuing those trends.\nAlexia Howard -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst\nAnd as a follow-up, can I ask about the magnitude of pricing that you're expecting across the portfolio? I mean, obviously, you've got pricing actions that have just gone into place. How much pricing do you anticipate being able to realize over the next few quarters or for the remainder of the fiscal year? Thank you, and I'll pass it on.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nAlexia, I think the way that we've articulated this consistently is that we're experiencing double-digit commodity inflation that is resulting in high single-digit cost of products, goods sold inflation, which is then resulting in kind of low to mid-single-digit pricing at the total company level. We haven't necessarily disclosed by each given commodity or business the pricing amounts or actions. But that sort of formula should be able to give you a sense. And then I would also share that on an underlying organic basis, we are anticipating at the new guidance range to be up at about 2 points.\nAnd as a result of that, you're going to see some top-line pricing being offset by some underlying volume as well. And so that should help you get a revised organic of about 2.5%.\nAlexia Howard -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Rob Dickerson from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nRob Dickerson -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you so much. My first question is just a quick follow-up to Alexia's question on the kind of cadence for the year, and then just a question on the pricing. So, Tucker, your last answer was helpful in terms of kind of how to think about that magnitude that we're seeing.\nBut kind of more specifically, I'm just curious, can the coffee business actually grow revenue this year, right? And we always sometimes, let's say, see the top line can decline, but gross profit still growing. In this case, just given this near-term pressure on cost, I'm curious, could we be looking at a retail division that's flattish for the year, maybe down a little bit? Because I think that would help us also be able to rightsize the total company as we get through the year.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nRob, good morning. As it relates to coffee and its growth trajectory, I think what we would say is, is that we're probably anticipating kind of flat to up based on what we're seeing today. But that would be inclusive of additional pricing actions. I think it's difficult for us at this point to continue to break down each of the business units.\nI think we've talked about kind of an underlying organic for total company being up 2.5 points. On the pricing front, just from a cadence standpoint, we took pricing in July. It's reflective, we've discussed that. We've also acknowledged that the additional pricing actions would likely come through in Q2 and Q3.\nSo that also should give you a sense of timing as well.\nRob Dickerson -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK.\u00a0\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nRob, I would just -- it's Mark. I would just add one thing on coffee, which is you'll recall that our strategy has been to ensure, number one, that we're participating in all the segments of the category, but also continue to shift the portfolio to the growing segments. So in that case, that being Dunkin', Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Bustelo and K-Cups are all -- all three of those are outpacing the segment or the category -- we are outpacing the category, excuse me. And even the Folgers brand has continued to gain share and its growth, particularly in K-Cups, has been strong as well.\nSo we feel like as the portfolio shifts, we are delivering against our strategy.\nRob Dickerson -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. Fair enough. And the follow-up kind of flows to what you were just discussing, Mark. In the prepared remarks, again referencing the coffee business, there's a line that says came in a little bit lower than expectations, right? Just a little lighter.\nBut then there's also the commentary around this increased distribution coming from Folgers. So I'm just trying to kind of rightsize that like why do you think maybe things were a little bit softer than you thought, but then also at the same time, what's really driving that increased distribution on Folgers brand? That's it.\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. If you look at coffee on a two-year basis, in that two-year stack, we are seeing 8%. So that's obviously very strong. And the distribution gains that were referenced, I think, in the prepared remarks were relative to primarily recent some shelf resets, as well as some new pickup at some key customers.\nSo those -- we haven't seen those come through our P&L yet, but that will clearly be a help as we move forward.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nRob, and I will also just -- Rob, I would also remind you that a year ago, we were experiencing the continued momentum of the early stages of the pandemic into our first quarter, and we had the inventory replenishment in the first quarter. So there is a big what we refer to as a COVID lap and particularly for your consumer and coffee businesses.\nRob Dickerson -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nYeah. I mean, bottom line, it seems like you can get pricing in coffee that's obviously coming through again once you've lapped the inventory build in Q1 and you get some incremental distribution. It doesn't seem like we're thinking of drastic elasticity as we get through the year. Is that fair? I'll leave it at that.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nThe direction that you're sharing seems reasonable.\nRob Dickerson -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nJason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nHey, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Two quick questions. I know the magnitude of inflation pressure that you're facing in the industry, largest facing, continues to escalate, and it's certainly a lot larger than any of us anticipated a couple of quarters ago.\nBut we've been talking about resumed inflation for about nine months now, yet you've got almost no price -- not almost -- you have no price rolling through your P&L yet, including areas like pet, where you're actually lapping deflation in the prior year. So what's been the impediment in getting price in the system so far?\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThere hasn't been any impediment, Jason. Most of the pricing was effective in July broadly, and it's now on shelf. So you're going to see that initial wave coming through in the second quarter. And as we work through some of the additional pricing across our business, as Tucker mentioned earlier, it will be effective likely in the end of the second quarter, the beginning of the third quarter.\nSo yes, we are confident that we will be able to work through that, and that will be reflected. And I'm sorry, the first part of your question, I -- could you repeat?\nJason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nYou answered it. We're good, we're good. So let me actually flip to my second question then. It sounds like, Tucker, just sort of unpacking some of the comments you've made already: pricing, somewhere plus\/minus 4%; implying volumes, somewhere minus 1.5 points or so.\nThat looks like a lower elasticity function than you've historically had, which -- I compare it to your trade spend, and last year in your 10-K you disclosed, it's now 39% of sales, which is up, what, 800 basis points from five years ago. So you now seem to be a lot more reliant on promotions to drive volume than you used to be. You look to be the only companies who actually didn't benefit from lower trade rates during COVID. And in the context of that sort of promotional dependence, shouldn't we expect elasticity to be higher than it historically has? What gives you confidence in underwriting sort of a lower elasticity function than history?\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nJason, I would say that on a year-over-year basis, pricing is going to contribute sort of up to mid-single-digit growth. And it's going to be offset by sort of low single-digit growth of volume\/mix\/other. And what you have to be careful about in the volume\/mix\/other is, one, it's underlying business momentum for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand, continued advancement of Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Bustelo and Dunkin', and advancement of our pet snacks portfolio, along with a return in the Away From Home business. But then it is offset by a decrease in at-home consumption.\nIt is also offset by supply chain disruption, which we are experiencing through our pet food portfolio, particularly in wet pet, and it's also offset by any additional trader promotion like you've talked about. But that trader promotion isn't the biggest bucket of what's causing sort of that change. And then lastly is I would just acknowledge that in our volume mix bucket, we also have factored in price elasticities for our pricing actions across the portfolio.\nJason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. So there's some nice mix benefits in there to contemplate. It's not -- you're not expecting volumes to only be down 1.5 or so.\nI think that's the answer, correct?\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect. There's a big bucket in there, to your point, where there's more than one variable.\nJason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK. All right. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nOperator\nThanks. Our next question today is coming from Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nPamela Kaufman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nMorning.\u00a0\nPamela Kaufman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nCan you elaborate on the factors that contributed to the sizable margin pressure in the pet segment this quarter? This was the lowest operating margin that you've reported in the segment to date. And how are you thinking about your outlook for segment profitability over the course of the year?\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nPam, as it relates to the profitability margin for the pet food segment in the first quarter, you are correct, it did experience a decline quarter over quarter. I think you have to acknowledge the cost inflationary pressures in that business driven by the underlying commodities, such as animal fats and proteins, along with the impact of transportation. And again, that was ahead of any pricing benefit due to pricing actions that were taken in July. So we would anticipate that the profitability in pet food come back in the back half of the year as pricing begins to reflect a half-a-year benefit against sort of a partial year first half, and then it will be down year over year due to the timing of price recovery against cost inflation.\nPamela Kaufman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks. And then I guess related to that, how are you thinking about your ability to take pricing in pet at a time when the business is underperforming your expectations?\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nPam, we have been able to take pricing and pass that through. And as we observe the market, we have seen our peers and competitors do similarly. And so we have confidence that we will continue to do that. And just reminding that pet snacks is really a key part of our strategy, and we do lead there.\nSo we are clearly not only in pet snacks but in other portions of our business have been able to do so. So again, just to point, the headline being that our pet business is performing to expectations with the exception of Nutrish. And so we have delivered against our algorithm on pet.\nPamela Kaufman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Bell from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now live.\nRyan Bell -- Consumer Edge Research -- Analyst\nHey, everyone. Morning. I was just wondering how you're thinking about some of the structural changes to your demand, not particularly around breakfast and lunch and pet snacks, given some of the incremental at-home activity that we've seen. And how is this reflected in your guidance?\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nRyan, thanks for the question. It's Mark Smucker again. As I started at the beginning of the Q&A, the demand has generally remained strong. I mean, using coffee as an example, 75% of cups consumed are still consumed at home and a lot more brewers in place.\nClearly, there are more pets out there. And so pet snacks will continue to do -- will continue to meet our expectations because consumers will continue to treat their pets. And so that will be another one. And then, of course, as I've discussed in the past, even post-pandemic, however, we define that, one thing is certain which is career professionals are going to continue to work from home more than they did pre-pandemic.\nAnd that will benefit us because it speaks specifically to breakfast and lunch occasions. So particularly in our spreads, peanut butter, and jelly, as well as our Uncrustables business, we would expect that to be a positive factor on our businesses.\nRyan Bell -- Consumer Edge Research -- Analyst\nThanks. Is there any sense for the magnitude of some of those impacts that you're modeling into your guidance? Or is that a little bit less so for fiscal 2022 and it's more of a longer-term question?\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nRyan, we are anticipating continued momentum in at-home consumption and our coffee portfolio, as Mark acknowledged, and our consumer portfolio also driven by the Uncrustables brand, along with the pet dynamics. And so as we continue to see how the pandemic plays out, as we continue to ensure the investment and reinvestment in our brands for the long-term health of our business and therefore for the benefit of at-home consumption and the stickiness of households that we've gained, we hope to continue that momentum in this fiscal year and beyond. Today is probably not the time to quantify what we think that is, but the momentum that we've generated continues to perform.\nRyan Bell -- Consumer Edge Research -- Analyst\nThanks. That's helpful. And then last question for me. Where do you stand having a normalized SKU assortment given some of the supply chain issues that have been experienced?\nTucker Marshall -- Chief Financial Officer\nRyan, what we continue to focus on are two things: one is advancement of our strategy and a component of advancing the strategy is our portfolio reshape. And a component of the portfolio reshape is making sure that we have the right SKUs in order to advance the given brand or category and that we would eliminate any unperforming or nonperforming SKUs. And so that remains consistent in any financial plan. And then I would say beyond that, we do continue to look at our inventory levels from a working capital standpoint so that we can continue to ensure that we have the right level of raw material and finished goods in support of our supply chain, but also in support of our customers and consumers.\nAnd so those are two areas where we continue to focus on in the near term. But right now, we feel very comfortable with the assortment that we have behind the business.\nRyan Bell -- Consumer Edge Research -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. I will now turn the floor back over to management to conclude.\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you for your time and interest in our call this morning. We do remain confident in our strategy and the delivery of our business, the underlying fundamentals, and the fact that we are still able to continue to invest in our business to ensure that we deliver against our strategy. So we hope that many of you will be able to join us virtually for our presentation at the Barclays global consumer staples conference in a couple of weeks, and hope everyone has a great day and a good weekend.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 41 minutes\nCall participants:\nAaron Broholm -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nAndrew Lazar -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nMark Smucker -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nKen Goldman -- J.P.

{"date":"Nov 22, 2021, 5:15 p.m. ET","exchange":"NASDAQ: URBN","q":"2022-Q3","ticker":"URBN","transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Urban Outfitters, Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal '22 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Oona McCullough, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. McCullough, you may begin.\nOona McCullough -- Executive Director, Investor Relations\nGood afternoon and welcome to the URBN's third quarter fiscal 2022 conference call. Earlier this afternoon, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three and nine-months period ending October 31, 2021.\nThe following discussions may include forward-looking statements. In today's commentary, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons will be made to the third quarter of fiscal 2020 referred to as LLY. It's important to note at this time, the global COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a significant impact on URBN's business. Given the uncertainty about the duration and extent of the virus' impact to the global retail environment, content discussed on today's call could change materially at any time. Accordingly, future results could differ materially from historical practices and results or current descriptions, estimates and suggestions. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOn today's call, you will hear from Frank Conforti, Co-President and COO; Melanie Marein-Efron, Chief Financial Officer and Richard Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. Following that, we will be pleased to address your questions. For more detailed commentary on our quarterly performance and the text of today's conference call, please refer to our Investor Relations website at www.urbn.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank J. Conforti -- Co-President and Chief Operating Officer\nThank you, Oona and good afternoon everyone. Today, we announced another record-breaking quarter. Before discussing the results, I first want to congratulate and thank all URBN team members. The record results we produced this quarter and this year are a tribute to your hard work, perseverance and above all your ability to successfully navigate a rapidly changing landscape. Thank you.\nI'll now give a high level view of our Q3 results followed by a more detailed analysis by brand. Total company sales grew by 15% to a third quarter record of $1.13 billion, driven by total retail segment comp sales increase of 14%. Strong consumer demand across most categories, plus skilled execution by our team, drove nicely positive retail segment comps at all brands. Total sales were driven by robust strength in full price selling, which resulted in a record low URBN third quarter markdown rate. This helped to generate outstanding merchandise and gross profit margin, despite inflationary pressures from freight, raw materials and wages. The combination of strong gross profits with well controlled SG&A expenses led to all three larger brands recording double-digit operating profit margins. Overall URBN produced a record third quarter results for total sales, operating income and earnings per share.\nAlthough we're certainly pleased with record results, we are confident that a myriad of supply chain problems throughout the quarter held back both top and bottom line results. Lack of new receipts depressed sales most in August and September. As receipt flow improved somewhat in October, we saw a commensurate improvement in our comp trends as well with October delivering the strongest comp of the quarter. That trend has continued into the fourth quarter with quarter-to-date URBN Retail segment comps exceeding their third quarter print. As of today, we believe we have sufficient inventory on hand and receipts coming in to support fourth quarter sales growth.\nNow moving on to detail by segment, starting with the Retail segment. Retail segment sales increased by 16%. Comp store sales declined in the mid-single digit range, but improved throughout the quarter with October coming in only slightly negative. As mentioned, lack of inventory in the first half of the quarter negatively impacted store sales. Total store traffic versus LLY was mid-teens negative but healthy AUR gain partially offset that deficit. By region, traffic in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest continue to outperform the major metro markets in New York, California and Canada. In Europe, traffic levels were stronger than the trends seen in North America.\nThe digital channel continued its rapid growth registering mid double-digit sales gains in North America and even larger gains in Europe. Overall, the strong digital performance was driven by increased sessions and improved conversion and higher AOB. Digital customer growth also remained strong with year-to-date total customers up 50% to LLY and 3% to LY.\nShifting to the Wholesale segment. Total Wholesale sales decreased by 15% versus LLY. Lower sales at Free People wholesale partially offset by an increase in UO Wholesale sales. As we've discussed previously, Free People wholesale has adjusted it customer mix, cutting back some accounts to better align with the go-forward strategy of concentrating on full price selling. While the strategy reduced sales in the short-term, we believe it has benefited the brand overall and resulted in improved profitability in the quarter and less discounted product in the market.\nI will now provide more details by brand, starting with the Urban Outfitters brand. The Urban brand delivered a 7% retail segment comp versus LLY. Double-digit direct sales more than offset negative store comps. The brand drove increased sale, despite a significant decrease in promotional activity during the quarter. Focus shifted from offering frequent dollar and percentage-off promotions two years ago, to highlighting everyday accessible opening price points in key categories. This strategy resulted in nearly 400 basis points improvement in merchandise markdowns, healthy improvement in gross profit margins and low double-digit operating profit margins.\nIn North America, UO entered the quarter with tight inventory levels, especially in apparel, accessories and shoes, and thus was highly impacted by supply chain driven late receipts. Light apparel inventory and fewer promotions led to a deceleration in overall comps from Q2, but fueled strong double-digit regular price comps and historically low markdown rate. In Europe, the brand experienced fewer delays in inventory receipts, better store traffic and delivered better comp than its North American counterpart, also along with a very low markdown rate.\nNow turning to Anthropologie. The brand delivered a 9% retail segment comp versus LLY. Like the Urban brand, Anthropologie entered the quarter with tight apparel inventory levels and like Urban, supply chain disruptions stunted apparel sales. Retail segment comp sales accelerated each month in the quarter, fueled by strong double-digit digital sales which more than offset negative comp store sales. Sales were driven solely by full price selling with regular price comps jumping by more than 50%. This led to a reduction in markdowns almost 300 basis points improvement in MMU and low teens operating profit margin. The brand proactively planned to receive holiday home product early this year, leading to elevated home inventory throughout the quarter. As a result, the home category produced the strongest comps in Q3.\nImproved inflows of apparel and accessories inventory at Anthropologie beginning in October have boosted sales trends in these categories. Within the apparel category, Denim produced the highest comp growth fueled by the Pilcro marketing campaign in early September. Sales of occasion and party dresses surged toward the end of the quarter as new receipts finally arrived. Momentum in that class has continued into November. We believe Anthropologie is well positioned to deliver exciting fourth quarter results as October's double-digit comps have accelerated in November with the customer shopping early for holiday trim, decor, home and apparel.\nNow, I will call your attention to the Free People brand. Once again, the Free People team produced an extraordinary quarter with retail segment comps achieving a staggering 55% gain versus LLY. Every product category recorded at least a strong double-digit regular price comp, while the total Free People brand generated powerful triple-digit direct comps, which easily offset the slightly negative store comps. Store sales showed sequential improvement in the quarter with October store comps turning positive. Free People's extremely low markdown rate for the quarter led to over 350 basis point improvement in merchandise markdown rate. Strong sales and gross margin growth all led to an impressive high-teens retail segment operating profit rate for the brand. The Free People Movement brand also delivered an outstanding quarter. Retail segment sales grew by close to 300% versus LLY and they opened six additional stand-alone Movement stores, bringing the total number to 15 at quarter's end. November is off to a strong start at both Free People and Movement, so we believe both brands could produce stellar results again in Q4.\nLastly, I will speak to Nuuly. As noted on our last call, our subscription rental business has seen a positive shift in customer behavior as COVID wanes and customers have returned to more normal behaviors. The brand is also in a better inventory position which helped fuel subscriber count growth of 55% versus last quarter to 44,000 active subscribers. We believe we are on target to reach our goal of 50,000 subscribers by year's end. In October, the Nuuly brand launched Nuuly Thrift, a new resale app. The app offers users a peer to peer resale platform where sellers can sell products and receive either a cash payment or choose Nuuly cash with a kicker that can be then redeemed for purchases at any URBN brand. We are still in the early innings of these rental and resale businesses and are -- and we are looking forward to continuing to grow Nuuly customer base over the coming year.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie, our CFO.\nMelanie Marein-Efron -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you Frank and good afternoon everyone. Now I will discuss our thoughts on our fourth quarter financial performance. As Frank noted, we remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us. Of course, there are always challenges to overcome and risk to our plans. The impact of COVID-19 is still driving numerous disruptions and cost pressures in many areas of the business. Logistics, sourcing, fulfillment, the overall labor market and product input costs remain constant areas of focus right now and the foreseeable future. We have several strategies in place to try to mitigate the ever-changing cost and operational challenges in these areas.\nWe believe the fourth quarter could continue to show healthy sales improvements versus fiscal year '20. We believe our retail segment comp sales growth could land in the mid-teens range, while the wholesale segment sales could decrease at a rate similar to the third quarter. Together, this would result in total company sales growth in the mid-teens range. Based on current sales performance in forecast, we believe our gross profit margins for the fourth quarter could show approximately 100 basis points of improvements to fiscal year '20. Much like our third quarter, this improvement could be largely driven by lower markdown rates as a result of strong consumer demand and solid product performance. We believe favorable markdowns could offset lower initial mark-ups and deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses. Lower initial mark-ups are likely to be due to increased freight and commodity price increases. Deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses are likely to be driven by the increased penetration of the digital channel as well as increased delivery and labor costs. We would also anticipate store occupancy to leverage nicely due to the increased penetration of the digital channel.\nNow moving on to SG&A. Based on our current sales performance and plan we believe SG&A for the fourth quarter could grow at a rate just below our sales growth rate, while still leveraging. Our planned growth in SG&A is primarily due to greater marketing and creative spend to support our robust digital channel growth. Additionally, our SG&A growth is a result of planned incentive-based compensation, which was largely not achieved in FY '20. Similar to the past few quarters, our team will manage SG&A relative to actual sales. We are currently planning our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% for the quarter.\nCapital expenditures for the fiscal year are planned at approximately $285 million. The spend is primarily related to providing increased distribution and fulfillment capacity to support our growing digital business and secondarily to opening new stores. We are planning on opening approximately 56 new stores and closing 21 stores for the entire fiscal year. Our new store opening number does not include franchise partner locations in international markets.\nLastly, I want to add that the current supply chain challenges brought on by disruptions in production and the global transportation network have resulted in delayed inventory receipt flow. As a result, we are continuing to strategically place earlier inventory positions in areas with lower fashion risks such as the home category. We believe these factors may elevate our inventory position at the end of the fourth quarter versus two years ago. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast, but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nI'm pleased to turn the call now to Dick.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Mel and good afternoon everyone. Well, the holiday season is upon us and we're optimistic about our prospects. Consumer demand remains powerful, despite the various sentiment reports that would suggest otherwise. The customer shopping early and often selecting both apparel and home products. Sweaters, dresses and denim seem to be the apparel items of choice this year, while candles, trim and holiday decor top the home list. Fashion newness remains more important than price, and though promotional activity is normally higher in Q4, we are still planning for a favorable markdown rate compared to LLY. As for inventory, receipt flows have improved over the past four weeks. So we are confident in our inventory will be sufficient to meet our sales goals. Total retail segment comps are currently running nicely ahead of Q3's rate. So in sum, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the fashion trends and strong customer demand and deliver another record quarter.\nOn our last conference call, I focused on two important URBN growth initiatives, FP Movement and Nuuly. We believe both hold significant promise and as Frank relayed earlier, both are performing well. Today, I would like to discuss a third initiative, AnthroLiving. AnthroLiving is the gift and home furnishings division of the Anthropologie Group. The brand selected this division to deliver outsized growth several years back and has not been disappointed. In the current year AnthroLiving is on track to deliver almost $150 million in incremental sales versus LLY. Our consumer research indicates that the average Anthropologie customer spends more on home products each year than on apparel. Given the size of the Anthro's apparel business, we believe AnthroLiving has an opportunity to be at least a $1 billion business. To capture that opportunity the brand over the past few years has invested in infrastructure, delivery capabilities, systems, marketing and people, including additional design, merchant and marketing talent. Those investments have paid off nicely, with total sales this year projected to advance by 44% against LLY. The brand's ambition is to add another $150 million in sales over the next three years. To achieve this, the brand plans to expand our assortment using a mix of internal design and artist designer collaborations, concentrate on certain iconic product categories like home fragrance and accelerate new customer acquisition by investing more in both digital and traditional marketing. Rapid growth from initiatives like Movement, Nuuly and the AnthroLiving in combination with core growth and our three brands should help URBN achieve its goal of driving double-digit sales growth in the years ahead.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. I want to thank our brand, creative and shared service leaders. I also thank our 25,000 associates worldwide for their hard work, their dedication and amazing creativity. I thank our many partners around the world for their extra efforts in helping us overcome numerous supply chain disruptions. And finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued interest and support.\nI will now turn the call over for your questions. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per caller.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nLorraine Hutchinson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThanks, good afternoon. So it sounds like you're confident that you'll have enough inventory for holiday, but as you think about spring, I guess two pieces. Can you get enough home inventory in early? And then second, do you think you'll have to continue to air freight all of your apparel in for the spring?\nFrank J. Conforti -- Co-President and Chief Operating Officer\nHi, Lorraine, this is Frank. I could take that one. So home is a perfect example of a category where we have extended our lead times intentionally, so for this holiday period and that is definitely benefiting the Anthropologie and the Urban Outfitters businesses, and we would anticipate continuing to do so for spring and summer next year to be able to support the business going forward.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd as to air freight. We're trying to use a little bit less air freight and that's why we're bringing things in sooner and we think we'll have success for that in Q2, more than in Q1.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKimberly Greenberger -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOkay, great, thank you so much. My question is on Anthropologie. I just wanted to ask about AnthroLiving. I'm wondering if you can help us understand what's the difference between sort of the traditional home offering that we know and love Anthropologie for, and have known it for over the last 20 years and the new AnthroLiving initiative? And if I could just follow-up on the Anthropologie apparel comments that you made during your prepared remarks. It sounded like the driver for the negative apparel comps in Anthro in third quarter was just simply lack of inventory. I'm wondering if you can comment specifically on whether that category has seen an inflection either in October or November, once you replenished? Thanks so much.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Kimberly, I'm going to ask Tricia to take that, since that's her purview. Tricia?\nTricia Smith -- Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group\nYes, hi Kimberly. As it relates to AnthroLiving, I think the gift part of the business has been established for many years. It continues to remain very, very strong and I think where we're seeing a lot of growth is in digital as well as now looking at the furniture and decor category, building that out. So the growth has come from, I would say both the established categories, candles as Dick mentioned, but also across the board all of those categories are growing very nicely. Both the gift and entertaining categories in stores and digital, and then our furniture business. So we're seeing growth across all categories.\nAs it relates to apparel, I think, as Frank mentioned, the early receipt challenges that we saw were difficult in August and so I'd say mid September. We are regular price comps of plus 50%, we were very, very pleased with and we saw apparel business returning back to comp growth by the end of October with now double-digit comps into November. So as I think Frank mentioned, denim, sweater footwear business is very, very strong and in addition to that, the dress business in occasion has been incredibly strong, particularly in the last three or four weeks. So we feel really good about our inventory position. The strength of our full price business as well as now the customers return to shopping for multiple locations and we feel like we're in a good position to be able to deliver comps.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Adrienne Yih from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAdrienne Yih -- Barclays -- Analyst\nGood afternoon and congratulations on the progress at all three brands, it's really great to see. My question is on inventory. I was wondering if you can give more color on the composition of that at the end of the quarter by brand and then by apparel relative to home? And how many weeks of supply are you pulling forward receipts? Thank you very much.\nFrank J. Conforti -- Co-President and Chief Operating Officer\nYes, Adrian. This is Frank. So I could tell you coming into the third quarter, we were certainly lighter than we would have liked to have been in almost all the apparel categories in all brands. I think both Urban and Anthropologie were more significantly impacted by this because their inventory volumes were a little bit lower than where Free People was running due to obviously the significantly strong Free People comp and not to say that Free People wasn't impacted as well. As the quarter -- the third quarter progressed, we certainly got into October and -- later in October, we certainly started to see those apparel inventory balances improve and on a commensurate basis we started to see our comps improve in both the Urban and Anthropologie businesses as well. I think, as always, we'd like a little bit more of what's doing really well right now, but we certainly feel like we're in a much better position now in the apparel categories than we were entering into third quarter and feel like we've got enough inventory to support the robust sales that we're currently seeing.\nAs it relates to the home categories, as I talked about a little bit earlier. We did bring that category in earlier strategically to try and protect against the longer lead times there as well as the increased cost, knowing that we had to -- in most of the classes within the home category have to use those containers. So that category was in a better position throughout the quarter and remains in a healthy position for fourth quarter as well.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo, Adrienne, this is -- to emphasize what Frank was just talking about, if you take an example like Anthropologie in the middle of the third quarter, their dress inventory was down in very mid double-digits and obviously that impacted their sales. As we received more inventory at the end of the third quarter and have received even more now in November, the dress inventory is back, not quite LLY but close and the comps have basically exploded and we are seeing even high double-digit comps in the dress category. So that's just one example of what we went through in Q3.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Boss -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks. So Dick, could you elaborate on the underlying health of the consumer. You had an interesting comment to kick off the call. And then on quarter-to-date is acceleration in same-store sales across brands as we enter holiday, do you see this as a potential pull forward of sales or do you think this foreshadows a potential double-dip holiday where the consumer buys early and late? Just curious of your overall thoughts.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay, Matthew, I'll try on that. If you take a look at some of the surveys that are out there, like the Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey. You know you'd get an impression that we are already in a recession. But I have to tell you that's not what we're seeing at all. We couldn't be more different. Our customers seem to be upbeat and they are definitely in a mood to buy. She seems to be trading up not down and she wants to be in functions and with friends doing the things that she used to do in her normal life. So I think the consumer is strong. She has put in a positive mood and most of the consumers that we're dealing with have the financial means to continue to purchase. So I think it augurs well for our prospects during this holiday and with that some macro shock that I can't really see right now, I think that mood should continue into the first quarter of next year. And your second question was...\nFrank J. Conforti -- Co-President and Chief Operating Officer\nQuarter-to-date trends.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nOh, quarter-to-date trend. Okay. Well, I'll give you a rundown of that. Our total retail segment comp for Q4 is currently above 20%. Europe is a little stronger than North America. All brands are producing positive comps above their Q3 print. Once again, Free People is mid double-digit positive and certainly Movement is helping that brand. Anthropologie's comps are in the high 20s and the Urban Outfitters brand is high-single digit positive. We look at it by channel, total digital comps are mid double-digit positive, while store comps are actually low single-digit, but positive, which is a change from what we've seen in the past. So everything looks very good right now, but I want to -- just please remember, we are early in the season, and we don't know how much sales volume has been pulled forward due to earlier Thanksgiving, but we're quite confident the [Indecipherable]. The heaviest volume days are ahead. So the current comp numbers could change, but I have to say right now as we sit here today, we feel pretty good about our prospects for Q4 and are hoping that we'll be able to record another record result.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Lejuez -- Citi -- Analyst\nOkay, thanks guys. Dick, I'm curious as you think about the first half of '22, how are you thinking about your unitwise by brand? And I'm curious how your answer would be different if supply chains were fully functioning? Thanks.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Paul. Well, one of the difference is, we're positioning fabric earlier and we're positioning fabrics to -- and we're buying more of the fabric to position it for multiple styles and multiple iterations of the same style. So in other words, we're going in and buying more fabric and getting better prices, doing it earlier, so that we can achieve non-inflationary prices on the fabric. And then the other -- a couple of other things that we're doing, we are buying what we're trying to buy more product of certain styles and this called a couple of the lower volume styles at the end of the tail. So to do this, we think we can achieve better IMUs on those things that we buy higher volume as a matter of fact, we know we can.\nSo how would it change if we didn't have the supply chain? Well, as you know, over the last six, seven years we have consistently talked about keeping our inventory as lean as possible, testing and learning and going back in quickly and buying more of certain items or things that are like the certain items that are selling and replenishing that way. Right now, we don't have the choice of doing that because supply chain is anywhere from four to six weeks longer than it was two years ago.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Altschwager -- Baird -- Analyst\nThank you for taking my question and good afternoon. Do you have an estimate for how much the inventory flow challenges might have weighed on sales growth this quarter? And as a bigger picture, it looks like sales are on track for maybe mid-teens growth LLY this year. Do you anticipate any pressure next year as we lap stimulus and there's pretty intense pent-up demand or how are you thinking about the controllable levers with things like the Free People Movement, AnthroLiving versus maybe the broader macro setup in the next year? Thank you.\nFrank J. Conforti -- Co-President and Chief Operating Officer\nHey, Mark. I can take the first part of your question relative to how much sales we think we walk. I mean obviously we don't have a perfect answer there, but I think we can comfortably say that we probably walk couple 100 basis points really honestly at probably all three brands by some of the supply chain challenges that we saw in the third quarter. I can let Dick talk a little bit about consumer demand next year and he is best of all.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks a lot Frank. Crystal ball, next year, I believe that the sales demand will continue. I think it is slowly, slowly decreasing but I don't expect any big changes. What could impact that? I don't want to go into all the possibilities of bad things happening. And there are some there, inflation being one. But I think that for the first and second quarters, I think we are fairly confident that consumer is still going to be fairly powerful.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.\nDana Telsey -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst\nGood afternoon, everyone. Dick in the last call you talked about taking price. How do you see taking price did -- is it expanded beyond the Urban division and where do you see pricing going? And then also anything in terms of how you're thinking about the real estate profile for next year in terms of openings and closings? Thank you.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nHow are you Dana? We are gently, may I repeat the word gently raising some prices across all categories and all brands. And with that is one of our answers to how are we going to operate in this inflationary environment. We have a number of other initiatives that we're doing and I'll let Frank talk about them in a second, but I will talk about the real estate first, and the real estate, we opened 56 stores this year and closed 20 some, I think for a net gain with 35, over half of those stores were Free People Movement stores, so rather small but highly productive. When we think about next year, we are going to -- we are planning to open basically the same number of net new stores, but we are opportunistic and what we are finding is that there are still pretty good lease opportunities out there to be had. So that could change as we move into the back half of the year.\nFrank J. Conforti -- Co-President and Chief Operating Officer\nAnd Dana this is Frank. You'd asked about price? Obviously, it's one of the strategies and opportunities to offset inflation. I think as we sit here today and look forward into next year, we certainly think inflation is going to continue and probably in multiple forms right, whether it'd be freight, raw materials, labor, just to name a few. I think, price is one of our strategies as Dick talked about sort of gently raising prices. Also we are conscious of wanting to protect that opening price points at all of our brands. We think that that's critically important.\nIn addition to that, I think we had mentioned earlier, we are going to extend our lead times in certain categories. This will enable us to increase our penetration transit, excuse me, ocean transit versus air which obviously favorably impacts our freight costs. We're going to increase the depth of product buys in certain areas. This is in order to obtain more favorable pricing. As Dick mentioned earlier, we are going to leverage earlier and deeper fabric positioning across more styles and deeper buys, enabling more favorable pricing there. And then lastly, we're also going to further utilize our CAD system and we believe that that's going to be able to increase some cost efficiencies in fabric. Examples, freight as well as our solid adoption rate. So as it relates to the inflation and are new pressures for next year, it really is a multi-pronged approach for us. It's not something where we just are looking to take price across the board and pass that all along to consumer. We think there's a lot we can do internally to hopefully mitigate some of those pressures. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Janet Kloppenburg from JJK Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJanet Kloppenburg -- JJK Research -- Analyst\nHi, everyone, and congratulations on the great progress.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks.\nJanet Kloppenburg -- JJK Research -- Analyst\nJust a couple of -- hi. Nice going. Dick I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your satisfaction with the improvement in the apparel business at Anthropologie and perhaps where you are in that journey in terms of getting it to where you want it to be? And of course Tricia your voice is also important in that question. And Frank, if you could help us understand the freight impact on gross margin in the third quarter vis-a-vis the first half and how we should be thinking about the freight impact in -- not only in the fourth quarter, but what that looks like for the first half as well? Just so we could model our -- trying to figure out, EBIT margins for next year. Maybe if you could give us a framework there would help? Thank you.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nJanet, as for apparel at Anthropologie, I would say that they're doing an incredible job. I don't want to make, Tricia blush, I know you can't see it on the line, but she is sitting right next to me, so I don't -- I want to be conscious that I don't -- I'm not too [Indecipherable], but things are very good at Anthropologie in both the apparel and home areas. And I would -- as I pointed out before, I would point out the dress business is just outstanding right now and being driven not just by occasion dresses, but by party dresses which Anthropologie really hadn't done a lot around until recently. And I think the other thing I think is very important in driving the Anthropologie apparel business is the inventory that the team is now creating and all the marketing efforts that they're doing. I think that that's having a very significant effect on Anthropologie's apparel sales. So I'm delighted with their sales. I think that -- I'm not suggesting there aren't areas that they couldn't do better, I mean as a retailer we always think that. But overall, I think I would give Tricia an A, for not just the effort, but the results. So I don't know Tricia if you want to add anything to that. She's very red right now.\nTricia Smith -- Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group\nI'm definitely blushing. No, I think we're -- from where I'm coming from, I think we're at the early stages of establishing some key categories as Dick mentioned. We're really leaning in heavily into establishing the footwear and the shoe business. We just launched shoes in 20 stores and sense to take that to more stores overall. I think the biggest opportunity Janet is us thinking about the occasion piece of the business as well as on our cash flow side. So you can see that in the strength in the investments that we made in Q3 in denim and just the investments that we've made in some key categories overall. I think the assets in the imagery are allowing us. The team has done a fantastic job I agree in allowing us to find new Anthropologie apparel customer in addition to, I think our existing loyal customer spending more with us at the same time. So I think, I believe we're at the early stages of continued growth in the Anthropologie apparel and happy with the way the team has performed than what we were able to deliver.\nMelanie Marein-Efron -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd this is Mel, I'd like to add that we're having a lot of fun in Anthropologie right now under Tricia's leadership. We're seeing that the customers' really gravitating toward fashion and we're really opening the doors whether it's with products or the imagery. We've taken a lot more risks this year than we have in the past and she is loving it. So all the teams are having a lot of fun. So its doing great.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Janet, for the second part of your question, I'll ask Mel to take it.\nMelanie Marein-Efron -- Chief Financial Officer\nJanet, when you -- to answer your question about freight and inbound freight specifically, when we look at our Q3 gross profits and how compared to Q2, a lot of the difference really is the increased freight, inbound freight. So when you compare Q3 and Q2, our markdown favorability was very similar versus prior year. But the headwinds that we experienced in Q3 were greater and those being specifically the inbound freight inflation, which lowered our MMU. And in addition, our gross profit was also brought down by increased delivery deleverage from higher carrier cost and greater logistics costs.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Marni Shapiro from The Retail Tracker. Please proceed with your question.\nMarni Shapiro -- The Retail Tracker -- Analyst\nHey, guys. Best of luck with holiday in case I forget at the end of this. The stores look beautiful now. Just can you talk a little bit about two things. One, just on the delivery delays, can you just clarify, did you see it across apparel more than home and accessories it felt that way and across all the brands equally? And then if you guys could just talk a little bit about your third party fulfillment or marketplace. I've seen you've layered in quite a bunch of new brands and new things even like fine jewelry under Free People and Anthropologie sites at much higher price points. I'm curious how you feel about that marketplace business and if it's something that you're looking to grow in 2022?\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Marni. I'll start with the delivery delays. Probably the biggest one of the quarter was -- actually it was in Q2, but it affected Q3 was when Vietnam was forced to close entirely for most of the month of July. And so all the product that we had on order and by the way, Vietnam is the third largest producing country which supplies Urban. So all of that product was just put on hold for the better part of the month of July. So all of the product that would have come in, in August through mid to late September was about 30 days late. So that was the biggest problem, and then of course all the things that I'm sure you know very well from talking to a lot of people about port delays and container problems that impacted us as well from all countries, not just Vietnam. So I think that what we saw was a big dip in -- we relied in apparel to begin with as Frank said, going into the quarter in August, but there was a big sort of sag a dip in the middle of the quarter when all of those factors that I just talked about took hold. And then we've received most of that now at the end of October and the beginning of November. And we're seeing the benefit of that in the comp sales. So I think, I don't know if Frank estimated a couple of hundred basis points of sales that we missed is correct, but I can tell you that I believe it's at least that if not more.\nOperator\nOur last question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Siegel -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks. Hey, everyone, good afternoon. Curious if you have any thoughts on lower UPTs. I think you mentioned at stores. I get the traffic pretty surprised at lower conversion UPTs. I don't know if that was compared to '19 or '20, but is there any thoughts or color there? And then, Frank, did you guys comment on what percent of 3Q inventory was in transit? Thanks so much and happy holidays.\nFrank J. Conforti -- Co-President and Chief Operating Officer\nThanks, Simeon, same to you. The lower UPTs was very, very small. And I can tell you, I think that's probably directly related to lower promotions. Typically we see that whether it'd be online or in stores, when you lower promotions that typically has an impact on UPT. So with the brand hosting 20%, 30%, 50% rate priced comps in the quarter with significantly reduced promotions. I think that was the largest driver there and really the primary driver there of any variance. And then as far as the inventory in transit goes, I think our total inventory was up roughly 18% and Melanie is going to correct me if I'm wrong, I think, comp inventory was roughly up 7%. So it gives you a sense there was a pretty healthy portion of inventory still coming in and being in transit that came in -- sorry about a quarter of our increased...\nMelanie Marein-Efron -- Chief Financial Officer\nInventory.\nFrank J. Conforti -- Co-President and Chief Operating Officer\nThank you. For the inventory was sitting there in transit. And that is then started to come in through our distribution centers now at half the stores and be available for sale digital and we think also is probably due in part to the consumer shifting up earlier, as well as us having more inventory to sell as part of the result, what we're seeing here an acceleration of sales for all three brands.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. And I like to go back, Marni asked a question about marketplace and so Sheila do you -- can you talk at all about that or Tricia?\nSheila Harrington -- Global Chief Executive Officer of Urban Outfitters and Free People Groups\nSure, I can start and -- I feel like marketplace has been a key strategy for the different brands, Free People and Urban for different reasons. It gives us a chance to expand our lifestyle offering, really test out opportunities and I think there is something to be built on as we continue to go after our direct to consumer business. So we think it is a very supportive arm of our growth of the D2C [Phonetic].\nTricia Smith -- Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group\nAnd for Anthropologie I'll say we've leveraged marketplace historically, mostly for AnthroLiving categories, but the team is working actively on developing our choice count expansion in apparel categories footwear and opportunities to be able to leverage marketplace to expand our assortment as well on the apparel side.\nRichard A. Hayne -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay, thank you. And I believe that concludes the call. I would certainly extend my warm wishes to all of you and hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving.

{"date":"Oct 30, 2019, 12:00 p.m. ET","exchange":"NYSE: HESM","q":"2019-Q3","ticker":"HESM","transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Hess Midstream Partners Conference Call. My name is Latif and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gordon, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nJennifer Gordon -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Latif. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hessmidstream.com.\nToday's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess Midstream's filings with the SEC.\nAlso on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the earnings release. With me today are John Gatling, Chief Operating Officer; and Jonathan Stein, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'll now turn the call over to John Gatling.\nJohn Gatling -- Chief Operating Officer\nThanks, Jennifer. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Hess Midstream's third quarter 2019 conference call. Today, I'll review our operating performance and recent highlights as we continue to execute our strategy and also discuss Hess Corporation's latest results in the Bakken. Jonathan will then review our financial results.\nEarlier this month Hess Midstream announced an agreement to acquire Hess Infrastructure Partners, including its incentive distribution rights in Hess Midstream and convert from an MLP to an Up-C corporate structure. With the acquisition of HIP's assets, Hess Midstream will become a large-scale, full service midstream company with no drop-down dependencies positioned for visible adjusted EBITDA growth and increasing free cash flow generation with a platform that provides opportunity for broad investor participation.\nTurning to Hess Midstream's results for the quarter, in late July, Targa Resources successfully brought online the 200 million cubic foot per day Little Missouri 4 gas plant. Gas processing volumes at LM4 ramp steadily in the third quarter and have averaged approximately 70 million cubic foot per day net to Hess Midstream during October. As additional Hess volume south of Missouri River were redirected to the plant. We expect to continue to build toward full utilization of our 100 million cubic foot per day share of LM4 over the balance of the fourth quarter.\nAs LM4 has ramped up, we have simultaneously backfilled the Tioga Gas Plant with increasing Hess production along with contracted and connected third-party volumes from a range of upstream and midstream customers maintaining TGP near its nameplate capacity of 250 million cubic foot per day. In line with guidance provided on the July call, total third quarter gas processing volumes increased by 9% compared to the second quarter. We anticipate further growth in gas gathering and processing volumes in the fourth quarter as LM4 continues to ramp toward full utilization. We're reaffirming our volume guidance for the full year 2019, we anticipate gas gathering volumes to be between 280 million cubic foot per day and 290 million cubic foot per day and gas processing volumes to be between 265 million cubic foot per day and 275 million cubic foot per day.\nOver the long term, we continue to expect third parties to comprise approximately 30% of our total gas processing volumes underlying our strategically advantaged infrastructure position in the basin supporting Hess and third-party customers.\nFor our crude oil business, third quarter crude terminaling volumes were 130,000 barrels of oil per day, an approximate 6% increase over the second quarter, primarily driven by increasing Hess production. We anticipate further growth in crude throughputs through the fourth quarter as Hess continues to execute its 6-rig drilling program. Third-party throughputs are expected to remain at approximately 15% of our total crude oil volumes.\nAgain, consistent with prior guidance, we anticipate full-year 2019 crude gathering volumes to be between 105,000 barrels of oil per day and 115,000 barrels of oil per day and crude terminaling volumes to be between 120,000 barrels of oil per day and 130,000 barrels of oil per day.\nNow turning to Hess Upstream highlights. Earlier today Hess reported third quarter 2019 production from the Bakken of 163,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing an increase of approximately 40% over the year ago quarter. For full year 2019, Hess has increased its Bakken production guidance from 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to approximately 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, demonstrating the strength of its acreage position and success of the plug and perf completion design, which is delivering the expected uplift in initial production rates, estimated ultimate recovery and, most importantly, value.\nAs previously announced, Hess plans to grow production to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021, which is a key driver of sustained volume growth for Hess Midstream.\nNow turning to Hess Midstream's capital program. We continue to make excellent progress on executing our capital program, focused on the expansion of gas gathering, compression, and processing assets and pipeline and well pad interconnects for Hess and third parties. During the third quarter we began civil construction and fabrication activities for the planned 150 million cubic foot per day TGP expansion. We expect to begin major construction activities in 2020 and the project is on place to be completed by mid-2021. The TGP expansion is expected to increase Hess Midstream's overall gas processing capacity to 500 million cubic foot per day. Our full-year capital guidance remains unchanged from our October 4th announcement. 2019 consolidated capital expenditures, including equity investments from LM4 and excluding acquisition capital are expected to be between $310 million and $345 million, of which $300 million to $330 million is allocated to expansion activities, including $120 million to $130 million in gas gathering and compression $75 million to $85 million in gas processing, and $105 million to $115 million in pipeline and well pad interconnects.\nTotal expansion capital attributable to Hess Midstream for 2019 including equity investments related to the LM4 gas plant and excluding acquisition capital is expected to be between $60 million and $65 million, which is unchanged from prior guidance.\nIn summary, we're on track to meet our 2019 financial and throughput guidance, while continuing to focus on strong execution of our expansion program. The new Hess Midstream platform lays a solid foundation to drive long-term and sustainable growth creating significant scale, financial strength and flexibility with the opportunity for broad investor participation, which enables us to unlock future value for Hess Midstream shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jonathan to review our financial results.\nJonathan Stein -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, John, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with the positive response to our October 4th announcement. As we have highlighted, the transaction will deliver important benefits to unit holders. First, contribution of HIP's 80% remaining economic interest in the oil and gas midstream assets and 100% ownership in HIP's water business creating significant scale for the new enterprise. Second, a transaction that is expected to be immediately accretive to Hess Midstream unit holders and deliver long-term accretion on a distributable cash flow per unit basis.\nThird, maintaining our commitment to 15% annualized distribution per unit growth through 2021 and increasing our targeted distribution coverage to 1.2 times. Fourth, eliminating IDR payments to sponsors and converting to an Up-C corporate structure with broader investor appeal. And finally, to achieve all of this in a manner expected to be non-taxable to current Hess Midstream unit holders and with a generous tax yield resulting in no material tax is expected to be paid for the next several years. These changes position Hess Midstream for visible adjusted EBITDA growth and increasing free cash flow generation while maintaining conservative leverage without the need for funding from the equity capital market to deliver our planned growth.\nAs one of the first steps in the proposed transaction, we commenced an offer to assume approximately $800 million of outstanding HIP notes in a par-for-par exchange and as of October 21, 2019, we received consents for greater than 99% of the aggregate principal amount of existing outstanding notes. The proposed transaction transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 subject to customary closing condition and receipt of regulatory approval.\nAs John noted, we are continuing to execute our strategic plan this year and we are complementing our volumetric growth with strong financial results. The start up of LM4 and the expected ramp in gas volumes for the rest of the year, will drive continued growth in our revenues, adjusted EBITDA and coverage, which we expect to be at least 1.2 times in the fourth quarter.\nOur third quarter results met the guidance we provided on our July conference call and we are reaffirming all financial guidance for the full year 2019. Net income guidance remains $415 million to $440 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $550 million to $575 million. And adjusted EBITDA attributable to Hess Midstream is anticipated to be in the range of $108 million and $113 million.\nOur full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance implies an increase in adjusted EBITDA attributable to Hess Midstream of at least 20% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as we continue to increase processing volume toward our new total nameplate capacity of 350 million cubic feet per day. With maintenance capital and cash interest attributable to Hess Midstream projected to total approximately $5 million for the full year, our distributable cash flow guidance for 2019 also remains unchanged, as expected to be in the range of $103 million to $108 million.\nHighlighting our expected strong growth on an annual basis, in 2019 we expect to deliver 15% distribution growth with at least a 1.1 times coverage with revenues that are 85% protected by MVCs and a competitive EBITDA margin consistent with our historical margin of greater than 75%.\nTurning to third quarter 2019 results, I will compare results from the third quarter to the second quarter. For the third quarter 2019, consolidated net income was $100 million compared to $91 million for the second quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $136 million compared to $125 million for the second quarter.\nThe change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA relative to the second quarter was primarily attributable to the following; revenues for our gathering and processing segment increased by approximately $13 million, primarily driven by increasing gas volumes, including the ramp up of the LM4 gas processing plant. Revenues for our terminaling segment increased by approximately $2 million, driven by increasing Hess production.\nTotal operating expenses including G&A but excluding depreciation and amortization, rail transportation pass-through costs and LM4 processing fees were higher, decreasing adjusted EBITDA by approximately $4 million, including higher seasonal maintenance activity during the period of approximately $2 million, initial work on the planned TGP turnaround project of approximately $1 million. And higher charges from Hess under our omnibus and employee secondment agreement of approximately $1 million from higher activity levels.\nAs a reminder, since LM4 was integrated into our contract structure to create a single processing fee, revenues from volumes processed at LM4 are included in our affiliate revenues. LM4 processing fees of approximately $1 million included in operating expenses were offset by approximately $1 million of adjusted EBITDA based on our share of JV results including earnings from equity investments and LM4 depreciation. Third quarter 2019 maintenance capital expenditures attributable to Hess Midstream were $0.3 million and cash interest was $0.6 million. The result was that distributable cash flow was $25.7 million for the third quarter 2019 covering our distribution by 1.08 times.\nIn the fourth quarter we expect distribution coverage of at least 1.2 times, yielding a full year average coverage of at least 1.1 times in line with our guidance. On October 24, we announced that the Board of Directors of our general partner approved our third quarter distribution that increased 3.6% quarter-on-quarter and 15% year-on-year, consistent with our distribution growth target. Gross expansion capital expenditures, including equity investments in LM4 in the third quarter were $110 million or $22 million attributable to Hess Midstream. Highlighting our ability to grow by primarily self-funding both our distributions and expansion capital program, we finished the quarter with just $11 million drawn on our $300 million credit facility.\nAs we continue to execute our plan for 2019, we also look forward to the closing of our transaction, including the acquisition of HIP assets and IDR simplification. We will continue with our long-term business strategy and our commitment to consistent and visible growth supported by our unique cost of service contract structure, while also having a business with meaningful scale, financial strength and flexibility that is open to our broad set of investors. With our new platform, we will offer a differentiated value proposition with adjusted EBITDA growth, free cash flow conversion and conservative leverage metrics that are best in class among leading midstream companies.\nThis concludes my remarks, we'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Stewart of Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is open.\nPhil Stewart -- Scotia Howard Weil -- Analyst\nGood afternoon. Jonathan, I wonder if we could circle back to the transaction and talk about the decision to pursue an Up-C corporate structure as opposed to a Full-C conversion maybe kind of what were the puts and takes there and what kind of the benefits might be to an Up-C versus a full corporate conversion?\nJonathan Stein -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. Thank you. So, the Up-C structure really provides multiple benefits. For us, it allows us to have access to a broader investor base, obviously together with the IDR simplification, we also will have a line [Phonetic] interest between the sponsors and our public equity holders. But in addition, it also, because ultimately the Up-C has a partnership at its base allows us to maintain significant integration with Hess Corporation, which has as our anchor customer and also as we co-develop, if you will, the Bakken together to optimize it and its 20% production growth is really underpinning our growth. So, that integration is really critical. So really the ability to have that broader investor base, but at the same time be able to maintain that integration was really key and allow the Up-C to be ideal choice for us.\nPhil Stewart -- Scotia Howard Weil -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. And then, I guess, moving on to the TGP expansion, I know you've talked about a turnaround period at some point during next year and you've kind of already provided guidance for what the full year throughput volumes will be, just wonder if you all could maybe provide a little more clarity in terms of the actual timing of when the turnaround will take place?\nJohn Gatling -- Chief Operating Officer\nSure. Thanks for the question. We're still in the planning phases of the turnaround. And that's -- so it's still moving around, as far as the actual duration of the turnaround itself, again, this is a maintenance turnaround that was already in the plan as it was built in and we're actually taking advantage of the maintenance turnaround to complete the expansion activities over that period of time. And all of this has been built into our plan, so it's in Hess' plan, it's also in Hess Midstream's plan as well. And we'll provide more information on the turnaround itself in the -- during the January call.\nPhil Stewart -- Scotia Howard Weil -- Analyst\nOkay, great. And then, I guess, one last one from me if I can. On the saltwater disposal business, obviously, understanding it's new to the structure, can you just talk about the capex requirements for that business to continue to grow at over the next couple of years and how that kind of fits in with your ongoing maintenance and kind of sustaining capex program of well tie-ins on an annual basis going forward?\nJohn Gatling -- Chief Operating Officer\nSure. And I guess, it's important to note as far as the water business goes, we've been kind of running the midstream business for some period of time both the obviously the Hess Infrastructure Partners, Hess Midstream, but also some of the Midstream assets that sat with Hess. So, these are not new assets to us, we've been actually operating these assets with the intent of packaging them and selling them into or -- Hess selling them into Hess Infrastructure Partners us acquiring and then ultimately making them available for Hess Midstream. So, that's been the plan and we've actually been actively managing the business and growing the business, as part of that.\nAs far as the capital requirements go, again, this is a growth business for us. This is considered expansion, as you know, essentially all of the, what I would say, non-traditional which would be like equipment replacements, things like that it goes into our expansion line from a capital perspective, this would all be expansion capital for us, it is -- has been and I would say the base in [Phonetic], generally speaking, has been under-invested in water services. So, it is a growth opportunity for us, it's got a substantial growth profile. I would say, it's a modest investment, it's not going to be a significant portion of our overall capital portfolio, but it's attractive, it grows rapidly, it's going to create a lot of EBITDA for us in the future, and we're going to continue to attack it aggressively for both -- to support both Hess and third parties as well.\nPhil Stewart -- Scotia Howard Weil -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. That's it from me.\nJohn Gatling -- Chief Operating Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\nDuration: 20 minutes\nCall participants:\nJennifer Gordon -- Director of Investor Relations\nJohn Gatling -- Chief Operating Officer\nJonathan Stein -- Chief Financial Officer\nPhil Stewart -- Scotia Howard Weil -- Analyst\nMore HESM analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"date":"Jul 30, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET","exchange":"NASDAQ: SPOK","q":"2020-Q2","ticker":"SPOK","transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nGood morning, and welcome to Spok's 2020 investor call. Today's call is being recorded. Online today, we have Vince Kelly, president and chief executive officer; and Mike Wallace, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. At this time, for opening comments, I will turn the call over to Mr.\nWallace. Please go ahead, sir.\nMike Wallace -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for our second-quarter 2020 investor update. Before we discuss our operating results, I want to remind everyone that today's conference call may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to Spok's future financial and business performance. Such statements may include estimates of revenue, expenses, and income, as well as, other predictive statements or plans, which are dependent upon future events or conditions.\nThese statements represent the company's estimates only on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to the actual future results. Spok's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Although these statements are based upon assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please review the risk factors section relating to our operations and the business environment in which we compete contained in our 2019 Form 10-K, our second-quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, which we expect to file later today, and related documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nPlease note that Spok assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking comp -- statements in past or present filings and conference calls. With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince. \nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I hope all of you, your families and friends are, and remain safe during this challenging time in the midst of this pandemic. At Spok, we continue to take this situation very seriously and have developed the protocols and procedures to be able to provide for the safety of our employees and our customers, many of whom are on the frontline, fighting this virus and saving lives. We are forever grateful for their service.\nWith regard to our operations, we're in the throes of 100-year pandemic that has created a huge negative impact on the finances of our healthcare customer base. Prior to COVID-19, most hospitals ran on fairly thin margins in the single digits. Most of their profitable business came from ambulatory care and elective procedures. These were more profitable activities that have been significantly curtailed, causing a very challenging financial environment for the healthcare sector.\nHowever, we at Spok, expect this huge segment of our national economy, that at one point was nearly 18% of GDP, to ultimately recover. In the meantime, we will continue running our business profitably, enhancing, and selling our wireless and software solutions, including our new platform, Spok Go while preparing for a future that has a positive outcome as our country eventually gets the virus under control. We believe in our core values of putting the customer first, respecting what they do matters, our commitment to innovation, and accountability. Further, we believe in investing in and building for the future, and we think what we've developed with Spok Go will be a game changer in clinical communications.\nSo while this pandemic has put a damper on our results in the second quarter and will likely represent significant headwinds for the foreseeable future, we believe in the long-term trends in healthcare and the need for a sophisticated system of action represented by Spok Go to enhance the many systems of record that already exist out there in the form of electronic health record systems or EHRs. More on that later. Turning to our second-quarter results. Software product sales and professional services access were negatively impacted.\nThis represented the first full quarter of the pandemic's effects. The majority of our healthcare customer base continues to struggle with the challenges presented by COVID-19. As I've mentioned, the pandemic is taking a heavy financial and human toll on America's already stressed healthcare infrastructure. While some parts of the country have started slowly phasing out stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, hospitals and health systems remain on the frontlines of this pandemic, and in some parts of the country, we see it getting worse.\nExperts have warned that the recovery pace for hospitals and health systems will be slow. However, we believe there are many reasons to be confident that Spok will emerge from this crisis and take advantage of the growth potential that exists in the markets that we serve. While undoubtedly hospitals are focusing their immediate efforts on supporting the current crisis, surveys have shown that by the end of the second quarter, hospitals were back to more than a third of their pre-COVID-19 elective volume, and by the end of the year, hospitals expect to be back to more than three-quarters of those volumes to full recovery sometime in 2021. Of course, that is subject to change and the virus will ultimately dictate the timing.\nWhile the situation is fluid and no one is able to predict the duration and severity of this pandemic with a high degree of certainty, we intend to take advantage of that momentum. Several of our larger deals for both our legacy software and Spok Go were pushed back and delayed into the second half of the year. Some of our customers are putting their budgets and new purchases on hold while they take stock of the economic impact of the pandemic. Some have changed their short-term priorities to PPP, telemedicine, therapeutics, and others.\nThis continues to make it extremely difficult to forecast sales. And while we did not book any Spok Go deals in the second quarter from our robust pipeline, we did this month and we look forward to reporting on that in October when we report our third-quarter results. We think going forward, the need to improve the experience and capability of clinical communications is only going to increase and we will be well-positioned with our integrated cloud-native platform, Spok Go. In the meantime, Spok continues to operate with a relatively stable revenue base.\nNearly 86% of our revenues in the second quarter were recurring in nature, coming from either our legacy wireless business or software maintenance contracts. As I've already mentioned, Spok provides a critical function, which we believe will become even more important in this environment. Spok's clinical communications platform provides hospitals a system of action, not just a sick -- system of record, like they do with their EHRs. We deliver reliable communications and clinical information, including critical test results and care teams when it matters most for improved patient outcomes, and we now do it on a new cloud-native platform that we truly believe will be a game-changer in clinical communications for years to come.\nI'm happy to report that cloud-native platform Spok Go just received its SOC 2 Type 2 certification. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong improvement in wireless trends and focused expense management, resulting in healthy levels of net income and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. We've returned a little over $5 million of capital to our stockholders through the first half of the year in the form of our regular quarterly dividend. We intend to continue paying this dividend for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to continue paying this dividend is not at risk. We are a company with no debt, adequate cash on hand, and positive cash flow. While operating the company profitably and returning capital to our shareholders quarterly, we will continue to further enhance our product offerings through our continued development in our Spok Care, Care Connect, and Spok Go communications platforms. Despite the current challenging environment, our goal is to run the business in a cash flow positive mode for the balance of the year.\nWe also continue our firm commitment to the development and enhancement of the Spok Go platform. Spok is pioneering a new era of clinical communication and patient care coordination, which goes well beyond today's myriad of point solutions for secure messaging and clinical workflow. The Spok Go platform is purpose-built in cloud and enterprise grade, specifically for healthcare. And here's why we believe it matters.\nFirst, we believe Spok Go provides hospitals and health systems address the security, agility, breadth, and depth of services, including enterprise management capabilities for anything from single hospitals to large multisite health systems: a cloud-native platform that intelligently routes messages alerts and information to the right person at the right time to enable easier and more timely care collaboration; an interoperable gateway that securely innovates with on-premise systems such as EHRs, clinical information systems, nurse call, and patient care devices; and easy applications that provide real-time access for information regardless of location or device for more flexibility and efficiency. Next, the Spok Go platform is assisting to drive action by connecting clinical teams with people and information they need when and where it matters most, helping to increase the time clinicians could spend with their patients to improve outcomes. It's built around a centralized call directory that manages clinical and nonclinical roles, contact preferences, and on-call schedules, and through our enterprise directory, it serves as a single source of truth for enterprise clinical communication. We engage clinicians to help shape the features of the consumer-grade user experience, while ensuring we deliver on the security and capability requirement unique to healthcare.\nFinally, our cloud-native platform is powered by the industry-leading Amazon Web Services. This unique architecture alleviates the burden placed on IT teams by on-premise systems, meets and exceeds security and compliance requirements, including HIPAA to keep patient information safe, ensures high availability and resiliency, protects from loss of connectivity, power, and service-specific failures, scales as the need of health systems change, and delivers continuous updates and faster access to technology enhancements and new features. I'm very proud of our team and their accomplishment. When we commenced this journey about five years ago, our goal was to create a beautiful software that would delight our customers.\nWe believe we have accomplished that goal. It's unfortunate that the timing when we brought this new platform to market coincides with a 100-year pandemic that is putting large financial pressures on our target customer base, but we still believe we have a winner that will be a long-term success and improve the way clinicians communicate for many years to come. Now before I turn the call over to Mike to provide additional details on our financial performance, I want to briefly review some key results for the second quarter. First, on a GAAP basis, in the second quarter, we generated $3.8 million of net income or $0.20 per diluted share, up from a net loss of $670,000 or $0.03 per lo -- loss per diluted share in the second quarter -- in the year-earlier quarter.\nAlso EBITDA totaled $5.2 million in the second quarter more than 15 times, an increase from the second quarter of 2019. Second, wireless subscriber and revenue trends continue to exceed our expectation. Spok posted solid results for wireless products and services in the second quarter. Gross pager placements of approximately 35,000 units were sharply up from the prior quarter.\nAs a result, net pager losses declined to approximately 11,000 units in the second quarter. We were pleased to see the continuation of these more stable trends, especially in our top-performing healthcare segment, which comprises nearly 84% of our paging subscriber base. Next, I'd like to address software revenue. While software maintenance levels remain at healthy levels, current situations had the most profound impact on software operations revenue.\nOn a GAAP basis, software revenue of $14.7 million was down from the prior-year quarter. However, our related software backlog at June 30th was $48.4 million, up nearly 22% from the prior year. The challenge we have had and continue to have is lack of access to install our backlog of prior bookings due to the hospital's inability to accommodate our professional services teams on location. We continue to do as much prep work remotely as possible so that when things do open back up, we can move in quickly to get these products installed and generating revenue.\nAnd we're starting to see some reopening on a regional basis, which is where our services group will focus its attention in the third quarter. Also, as I mentioned, before the current healthcare crisis, it's also a financial crisis for many of our customers. Thus, bookings have been challenged. We were on plan in the first two months of this year.\nWhen March hit, things really slowed down and the entire second quarter was tough. Many deals got put on hold and pushed out. We expect most of these to revert back, but again, much will be dependent on the pace of the virus. Our sales teams will continue to be laser-focused on generating activity through the remainder of the year and booking additional sales of our Spok Go platform to go with the large success we booked last week.\nWe are also pleased to announce that all 20 adult hospitals and all 10 children's hospitals named at U.S. News & World Report's 2020 and 2021 Best Hospitals Honor Roll use Spok use clinical communication solutions to facilitate care collaboration and support exceptional patient care. For eight consecutive years, Spok has partnered with all of the adult best hospitals. Finally, Spok continues to demonstrate disciplined expense management.\nMike will review the specifics for the quarter in a few minutes. However, let me point out that we continue to make the necessary investments in our product and development and our sales and marketing infrastructure to support the evolution and sale of our new platform. That being said, we posted second-quarter adjusted operating expenses down nearly 13% on a year-over-year basis. I'm proud of what our team has been able to accomplish in this area in such a short time in order to align our expense base with the drop-off in demand we've seen since March.\nIt is a result of all our team members across the board, sacrificing the long-term benefit of Spok, and all our constituents. However, we did a lot more than just cut costs in the second quarter. I'm excited to share some of our new business during Q2. We added six new customers to the Spok family, including two wireless and four software.\nI'd like to highlight a couple of the six-figure second-quarter deals for you. First is one of the largest not-for-profit integrated health systems in the United States. This Northern and Central Illinois and Eastern Wisconsin health systems comprised of 26 acute care hospitals, an integrated children's hospital, psychiatric hospital, primary and specialty physician services, outpatient centers, physician office buildings, pharmacy, rehabilitation, and home health and hospice care. The health system is comprised of more than 30,000 employees, nearly 7,000 staff beds and has 8,500 affiliated physicians.\nThis premier Spok customer with multiple solutions, including operator console, enterprise rep directory, on-call scheduling, and code paging has been a Spok software partner for more than 10 years. Our team positions Spok as a true enterprise partner by aligning this health systems infrastructure consolidation, application standardization, and scalability to support the growing hospital network. As a result, we were able to upgrade the health system to Care Connect 1.9 and migrate multiple disparate systems into one consolidated enterprise system that is highly available and redundant throughout 14 Midwest hospitals. The next deal I'd like to highlight to you is a health system that has more than 12 million health plan members, 200,000 employees, nearly 23,000 physicians, 60,000 nurses, 39 hospitals, 690 medical facilities with combined $2.5 billion in net income or nearly $80 billion in operating revenues.\nThey operate in eight states on the largest managed care organization in the United States. This premium Spok customer has multiple solutions, including operator console, enterprise web directory, messenger, and code paging. They've been a software partner of ours for more than 16 years. Spok solutions are currently present in 39 of their hospitals across the Western United States and two call centers in the Mid-Atlantic region.\nOur teams worked to consolidate their SQL servers by installing three to four site databases, with unique database names on a single SQL server. Ultimately, this will reduce the customer's SQL spend by 75%. The result was an enterprise-grade upgrade to the Spok console. These are just a couple of examples of the activity level in the second quarter.\nI'm very proud of what our sales team has been able to accomplish against the strong headwinds created by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll make some additional comments on our business outlook shortly, but first, Mike Wallace, our chief operating officer and chief financial officer, will review the financial highlights for the quarter. Go ahead, Mike.\nMike Wallace -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Vince. I will provide a more detail -- uh more detail on our financial performance in the second quarter, but I would again encourage you to review our second-quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, which we expect to file later today as it contains far more information about our business operations and financial performance than we will cover on this call. As Vince noted, in the second quarter and in response to the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, Spok was successful in taking immediate steps to position our operations into a free cash flow posture through several cost-saving initiatives. Coupled with continue with -- continued strong wireless revenue trends, we were able to generate net income of $3.8 million or $0.20 per diluted share, a sharp reversal from the $4.5 million loss in the prior quarter and $670,000 loss in the prior year.\nWe were also able to generate $5.2 million of EBITDA or $1.6 million when adjusted for capitalized software development costs, which was up from last year's EBITDA loss of $2 million or a $3.7 million loss when adjusted for capitalized software development costs, and EBITDA of $343,000 in the prior-year quarter where we did not have such capitalization. However, as Vince detailed, our operations continued to be significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and the toll that it is taking on the North American healthcare infrastructure. The most severe impact was to our new software product sales and software bookings totaled $15.4 million. Additionally, the pandemic also negatively impacted our ability to deliver professional services to our hospital customers due to the various access issues caused by COVID-19.\nOver the next few minutes, I will review key areas which drove our second-quarter financial performance. They include: first, a review of certain factors impacting second-quarter revenue. Second, selected items which influenced second-quarter expenses. And lastly, a brief review of the balance sheet.\nAs usual, if you have specific questions about these items or any of our quarterly financial results, I will be happy to address them during the Q&A portion of this morning's call. With respect to revenue for the second quarter of 2020, total GAAP revenue was $35.7 million, compared to $39.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. Through the first quar -- through the first six months of 2020, GAAP revenue totaled $73 million, compared to revenue of $81.3 million in the first half of 2019. With respect to wireless revenue, first half performance was driven by low-level -- low-level pager unit churn on both a sequential and year-over-year basis.\nAs a result, wireless revenue for the first half of 2020 remained solid, declining only 5% from the prior-year period, a 150-basis point improvement from last year's first half performance. These continued strong trends in our wireless business are being driven by the combination of solid gross additions, continued minimization of churn with existing customers, and maintaining stable unit pricing. For software revenue, total second-quarter performance of $14.7 million reflected a nearly 16% decrease from the second quarter of 2019, with year-to-date software revenue down similarly from prior year levels. This performance was driven primarily by a nearly 30% year-over-year decline in software operations revenue as the pandemic continues to be most impactful to this revenue category.\nWhile we are certainly not satisfied with this performance, we are encouraged that the decline was primarily due to timing delays, and several of those projects remain in the pipeline for the second half of the year, both from a bookings and professional services standpoint. Regarding software maintenance revenue, which is a critical source of our recurring revenue stream, second-quarter and year-to-date 2020 revenue was $9.5 million and $19.2 million, respectively, versus $10 million and $20.2 million in the corresponding year in that [Inaudible]. The decrease in maintenance revenue was driven by a number of factors including: first, timing differences between periods, which resulted in approximately $500,000 to $600,000 greater revenue in the first half of 2019, as compared to the first half of 2020. These timing differences are primarily one-time items that relate to specific renewal contracts that do not have auto-renewal terms and for which we must negotiate at the end of each term.\nAlso impacting the higher levels of 2019 maintenance revenue were foreign exchange differences in certain of our global customers. As regards to the first impact, we are generally precluded from recognizing revenue on these contracts until new terms have been agreed upon, even though we typically will continue to provide maintenance service for these customers while negotiations are ongoing. The timing of these negotiations can vary significantly from one year to the next. Not only were these types of renewals more significant in the first half of 2019, but there were also a number of contracts that have historically been renewed during the second quarter, which moved into the second half of 2020 as we continue to negotiate with these customers.\nSecond, over the past several quarters, we have seen a decrease in the amount of license bookings in the mix of our legacy software solutions, which drives new and incremental maintenance revenue. This decrease is the result of our deliberate push to upgrade legacy customers to version 1.9 so that they are prepared to make a transition to Spok Go. These upgrades are heavy on professional services with little to no license value. Additionally, our overall bookings have been impacted over the last four to five months as a result of COVID-19.\nWhile we believe the decline in sales related to COVID-19 is primarily timing, meaning we do not believe we have loss sales, rather contracts delayed by COVID-19 will be closed in a future period. Many hospitals have furloughed employees in clinical, administrative, and technology positions in order to ensure sustained cash flow during these unknown times. As a result, our bookings may continue to be impacted until our customers can bring their operating levels back to at beyond just critical needs and emergency services. And third, our ability to increase annual maintenance charges to customers has continued to decline, given our legacy software solutions are toward the end of their normal lifestyles -- life cycles, with the majority of our new development efforts directed toward Spok Go.\nThese increases have traditionally offset much of our normal revenue churn. As we continue to focus the majority of our development efforts on Spok Go, we anticipate a purposeful, continued decline in our ability to sell new licenses for the Care Connect suite of products. While we have not seen a meaningful change in our normal customer churn, our ability to replace this churn with new revenues will not likely replicate what we have accomplished historically. Our intent is to replace this churn with the sale of Spok Go, as well as, transition existing on-premise customers to our cloud-based solution over the next several years.\nGiven these dynamics, one should expect relatively flat to down annual maintenance revenue as we move forward, and especially so, as we begin the process of transitioning existing customers to the subscription model. Turning to operating expenses. We continue to main our -- maintain our focus on creating efficiencies in our expense base and implementing cost reduction initiatives to offset the impact of the pandemic on our revenue streams. For the second quarter of 2020, we recorded adjusted operating expenses, which excludes depreciation, amortization, and accretion, and includes capitalized software development costs of $34.1 million, down nearly 13% from $39.2 million in the year-earlier quarter, with reductions in all expense categories.\nAlso benefiting operating expenses for the second quarter of 2020, Spok received approximately $800,000 in CARES Act credits, as well as, approximately $2 million in cost savings from the previously discussed employee furloughs. We currently expect the furloughs and other -- and our other cost initiatives to continue through the third quarter. We will evaluate our trends at the end of the third quarter and make a decision on further furloughs and other cost-saving measures at that time. Our capital expenses in the second quarter were approximately $846,000.\nThrough the first six months of 2020, capital expenses totaled $1.9 million and are down nearly one-third from the first half of 2019, again, as we determine ways to preserve cash. Capital expenses are incurred primarily for the purchase of pagers, network infrastructure to support our wireless customers, as well as, the necessary infrastructure to support our software business. We do not expect any significant changes to the level of our capital expense requirements for the balance of 2020. Turning to the balance sheet and other financial items in the second quarter of 2020 and through the first six months of the year, Spok generated approximately $5.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of EBITDA.\nThis, along with cash on hand, was used to fund the first half quarter -- the first half quarterly dividends of $5 million and capital expenses of $1.9 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $70.9 million, down approximately $6.4 million from December 31st, 2019. Finally, with respect to our financial guidance for 2020, Spok has been focused on continuing to understand the impact of the pandemic on our business, particularly, given the impact of COVID-19 on the rollout of our Spok Go software business, as well as, our legacy business, which is currently driving our software revenue during this pivot. Like many of our peer public companies, we believe that it is most prudent to continue to suspend our practice of providing annual guidance for revenues and expenses at this time.\nWe look forward to returning to our normal guidance format after the crisis is over. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for some closing comments before we open the call up for your questions. Vince?\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nReally great job. Thanks, Mike. OK. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on a couple of items.\nFirst, I want to update you on our current capital allocation strategy. And then second, I want to review our key goals and business outlook in the balance of the year. With respect to our current capital allocation strategy, our overall goal is to achieve sustainable, profitable business growth while maximizing long-term stockholder value. Toward that end, the allocation of capital can be the primary area of focus.\nOur multifaceted capital allocation strategy still includes dividends and share repurchases as appropriate, as well as, key strategic investments that augment our product, development, operating platform, sales, and infrastructure. Our strategy also includes the potential for acquisitions that are more strategic in nature and that are accretive to earnings. However, as I've mentioned in prior quarters, our main focus is on the development and enhancement of Spok Go versus acquiring additional functionality right now. We believe the cost of acquisitions and the integration of disparate functionality is much less efficient, and ultimately, limiting than the internal build approach we are taking at Spok.\nWe're confident in the transition and believe that financial flexibility over the long term is important to the success of our strategy. That is why we adjusted our cost structure and intend to continue paying our quarterly dividend while investing in our future. Focused -- laser-focused on selling and enhancing the next-generation of our software platform. As I've said, we believe that our cloud-based and fully integrated communications platform will be a game changer in our chosen markets.\nWe will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy and communicate our plans to you each quarter when we report earnings. Finally, with regard to our key goals and business outlook, we believe our efforts in the first half of the year have positioned us to be successful as the market eventually recovers from this pandemic. We will remain nimble in being able to react to changing market conditions and being able to quickly align our operations with the demand levels that we're seeing. We've have [Inaudible] Spok and our predecessor companies going back to 2004, we've generated over $992 million of free cash flow, and returned the majority of that to our stockholders.\nI'm personally most comfortable generating cash and returning that cash to our shareholders. However, in years prior to our acquisition of Amcom and our entry into the software business, we generated significant cash and returned it rapidly to our shareholders. While we're doing this, the value of our stock dropped significantly. This is something because we were distributing the value of our company to our shareholders at a rapid rate, but not doing anything to invest and create future value.\nWe believe it is the job of a public company to create long-term future value for all its stakeholders. We also believe that our investments in developing the Spok Go and building a world-class team will pay off in the long run, and we will be positioned to both grow our equity value while making profits and positively changing the world through enhanced clinical communications. I'd like to thank our shareholders for their patience and support. I'd also like to thank them for their participation in our annual meeting earlier this week.\nAs we reported, each of the 10 nominees to the company's board of directors was elected to one-year terms. Spok does not have a classified board and our directors stand for reelection every year. This is one of the reasons our governance score is so high. Additionally, Spok Holdings, Inc.\nstockholders voted to approve the following items proposed by the board of directors: the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, as the company's independent auditor, in an advisory vote, the compensation of Spok's named executive officers as described in the 2020 proxy statement, and the company's 2020 equity incentive award plan. Lastly, the shareholder proposal regarding board of director independence and refreshment was defeated. Final voting results will be filed with the SEC. OK.\nSo at this point, I'll ask the operator to open the call for your questions. [Operator instructions] Operator?\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Brad Gold with Capital AU Consulting.\nUnknown speaker\nGood morning, Vince. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I have two questions, if that's legal here. They're usually not that many.\nI guess, my first question has to do with the visibility of your software business. As I understand from your verbiage and your earnings, as well as, what you said today, you seem to be blaming most of your poor performance on the pandemic. But if you look at Vocera, they had a great quarter with the pandemic. And if I go back to your previous earnings reports in the third quarter of last year, you said you were going to give us guidance in February when we release earnings.\nWe expect not only revenue growth but pretty significant operations booking growth as well both from legacy solutions and new Care Connect. And then in the fourth quarter, you told us that, thank you for your support and patience. This is in response to a shareholder's question. I get your frustration.\nWe're behind in delivering the platform. We didn't deliver when we thought we would, on and on and on. So I guess my question is, it seems as though the problem was pre-pandemic and why should shareholders feel any confidence in you being able to perform moving forward? It woudn't.\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK, great. Thank you for both of your questions. I also look up to our -- look forward to our follow-up call that we have. I think it's on Monday that you scheduled with us.\nBut let me dive into the problem --\nUnknown speaker\nBefore you answer, that was my first question because I had a question on valuation. Thank you.\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAll right. Let me answer this question and then you can ask that question, how's that?\nUnknown speaker\nPerfect.\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK. First of all, with respect to Vocera's performance in the second quarter, I'm happy for Vocera and I'm happy for their shareholders. I'm glad that they had a good quarter. One of the things that's happening as a result of this pandemic has been a huge impact.\nHospitals have had to, on a very quick basis and on a short-term basis, changed their priorities. And one of the things that's top of list for their priorities right now is PPE, Personal Protective Equipment. And Vocera's badge, as you know, is a hands-free device. You don't have to touch the badge.\nAnd so, they've had some great results in the first half of this year with respect to selling those badges. I mean, those -- I look at those badges like I look at our pagers, they're great. They're certainly not the future of technology in terms of driving long-term value. We're shortly in the middle of a pandemic when they can be treated as PPE.\nThat's fantastic. You notice our paging result getting better, not growing like Vocera's devices are growing, but it's great. But we also noticed in the second quarter, Vocera's software revenue way down, down like 20.6% on -- from the second quarter a year ago. And that's no different really than what we're seeing.\nWe're seeing our software revenue down, as well as, a result of the pandemic. We had a number of very large deals ready to roll, ready to book, push on us. So we have a lot of customers come to us, they give their various reasons, but they all point back to the pandemic. So if you don't think the pandemic is real and you don't think it's impacting an industry that was up to 18% of our GDP but largely operated on average of 2% to 4% margin, and their most profitable business or ambulatory or outpatient business and their elective procedures have been put on hold as a result of pandemic, that suggests to me, you don't understand the industry in which we operate.\nBecause the fact of the matter is, it has been significantly impacted. We have the CIO of Ad -- Advocate Aurora on our board of directors. She has given us indications of what are happening inside that organization. We have the former CIO of Harris Health System, the third-largest health system in the nation, as our CIO today and he still got contacts inside that organization.\nThey're hurting. We've looked at multiple surveys and industry pieces about what's going on in their hospitals, they're hurting. So we aren't thinking that we're using the pandemic as an excuse. We're sharing with you the reality of the impact this is causing, not just on Spok but on our customers.\nNow having said all that, we did book a very large Spok Go sale, our first big platform sale, we're delighted about that. We have more in the pipeline. Our pipeline has continued to grow. We have warmed right up to the altar and they literally came back to us -- a household name, huge healthcare network, literally came back to us and said, we have to put this on hold.\nOur CEO said to freeze all new projects until we do the budgeting for next year. I mean, this pandemic is a real issue on our results. So glad for Vocera. Happy for them.\nI think that badge is a great solution for what's going on in the world today. I think that cloud-native platform that we've created, that we've named Spok Go is the great long-term solution for clinical communications in the United States, and we're going to continue to support it and we're going to continue to sell it. We're going to make you a lot of money with it if you remain a shareholder.\nUnknown speaker\nAnd that's a perfect -- that's a perfect segue to valuation. I guess, last quarter, you wrote that the company was worth $10 exclusive of software. Basically, the stock is trading now at $9.60 and according to my numbers -- you know, your numbers, you've spent $218 million on the software business. I would say it's closer to $300 million.\nAnyway, between $11 and $15 a share and we're getting no value. So I guess, my two questions are, can you explain why we get no value for the greatest thing that's coming? And number two, if you had to grade yourself since the purchase of Amcom, how would you grade yourself on the effectiveness of what you've done there?\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, first of all, I don't agree with the numbers you threw out there, so I'll have to see if you could send me backup or something because both of us are sitting here shaking our heads, saying we never -- don't agree with that.\nUnknown speaker\nWell, basically you delayed the [Inaudible] share.\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Brad, we're not going to get credit for Spok Go until shareholders can see a lot of sales of Spok Go. And when they start seeing a lot of sales of Spok Go, I believe the stock is going to go up. And I believe it's going to be a great long-term solution for our customers, a great long-term solution for our employees, and it's going to improve clinical communications and the quality of life of these caregivers. And that's what we're working for.\nWe want to make you guys money, but we also have a passion about what we do and we're going to be successful doing it. You don't have to believe that, but obviously, you have vision because you've held on to your stock, so you probably feel it's coming. Otherwise, you would sell, right? So thank you for that support and thank you for that endorsement.\nUnknown speaker\nOh, it's actually -- what I think is that a number of your shareholders over the last six months: B. Riley, Palogic, [Inaudible] an activist who joined your board, another investor forced a new board member on. I think people are getting a little impatient because it's been five years. So I think that you've been running this company for 15 or 16 years, it's time for some change.\nAnd I think, a lot of people are investing because they think in different hands this asset would perform better. So I appreciate you taking my questions, but I think that that is an attitude that a lot of people share and it's one that you should think about. So thank you for taking the questions.\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks. Hey, thanks, Brad. I appreciate it. I do think about it.\nI do value your feedback. You and a very small minority of our shareholders are welcome to voice your concerns and voice your opinions all you want. You guys did yesterday or you guys did Tuesday at the shareholder meeting. But you're a very small percentage and all our shareholders, the overwhelming super majority of our shareholders supported this board and supported our strategy going forward.\nAnd again, my goal is for them to be successful and my goal is for you to be successful. I have run this company for a very long time, as you point out. I have generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow and given the majority of that back to our shareholders. When we were developing Spok, we ran into a flat period in terms of our software sales and cash flow and that caused our stock to be flat for a very long time.\nI get that. But before we bought Amcom, our stock was dropping precipitously because we had no future. Now we have a future. Now we have a platform.\nNow we're generating money, we're operating profitably, returning capital to shareholders, and we have a future platform that we believe is that much better and far more superior than what our competitors have, and we think that's going to yield very positive results. Thank you. Let's go to the next question.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] We'll take our next question from Ryan Vardeman with Palogic.\nRyan Vardeman -- Palogic Value Management LP\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the Spok Go win. Can you give us a little bit more color as it relates to the profile of that customer, kind of the scale and scope of that engagement, and how you're pricing it, which might then give us a little bit more visibility on to kind of the opportunity that's there for other customers? Thanks.\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo. We're going to do that, like I said, in my opening comments, Ryan, when we report third-quarter results in late October.\nRyan Vardeman -- Palogic Value Management LP\nOK. Do you have any more color that you'd like to or could provide as it relates to the total opportunity set for the company in general, or how you're intending to price Spok Go more generally and more broadly?\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. We have a pipeline that we review on a regular basis and it continues to grow. I'm not going to give the specifics of that pipeline in terms of how many deals, what the average deal size, or what the total is, but it has grown consist -- considerably in this quarter. And we expect that'll continue to grow and that we'll continue to book sales out of that pipeline.\nAlso, I think the potential that we have to sell Spok Go is only going to increase as a result of this pandemic, number one, because hospitals are going to realize how important timely clinical communication is. One of the things that our platform does and it does it very, very well, is it delivers critical test results when and where it matters most. And as you can imagine, with COVID-19, you know, and with all the delays in people getting results, the quicker you can get information into the hands of people, the more effective you can be fighting as pandemic. So we think sales is only going to increase.\nThat functionality that we've built into the platform will be a big selling point. And then, we think when we deliver R3 at the end of the year -- by the end of the year, that pipeline opportunity will expand yet again because that's the release where we actually have then the full functionality with respect to our own contact center integration. And so, we'll have a lot more customers in our existing customer base that we can go to. We have 2,200 customers at our hospitals right now and that's a huge opportunity set for us to go back to.\nThe other nice thing about Spok Go in terms of future opportunity, Ryan, as you know, most of our customers, historically, if you run it against the definitive database and look at our customers, the overwhelming majority have been large customers over the years. They've been 600-beds-plus hospitals. And the reason for that is because when we sold premise-based software, it requires aisle servers, as Mike mentioned earlier, it requires a lot of professional services and those people that are expensive per hour. And so, that has been limiting in terms of how broadly we can distribute and sell our products because the medium-size hospitals and some of the smaller hospitals just didn't have the budgets to be able to do that.\nNow with Spok Go, it's a cloud SaaS -- a SaaS-based model, it's something that they pay for over time, and so, this is an opportunity for us to also sell into the medium and smaller-sized customers in the future. So this one's going to be a winner. And yeah, it's going to take time. And yeah, it's unfortunate when -- when the timing of when this pandemic hit, right, we delivered this thing to the market.\nBut I believe in it, Ryan, and you and I know we had our differences on a lot of things, but I truly sincerely hope you, Brad, all of our shareholders are successful as a result of this because I'm telling you, I believe in it.\nRyan Vardeman -- Palogic Value Management LP\nYeah. I think kind of [Inaudible] the opportunity and giving us scale and scope at some point, as well as, kind of how you're planning on billing folks at some point, kind of just providing a business model, if you will. I think, could be very instructive in helping educate us as it relates to the opportunity. Anyway, thank you for taking the question and thank you for the cost controls.\nHave a -- have a good one.\nVince Kelly -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. No, I appreciate it, Ryan. And I will just say this about what you were just saying a second ago. We intend, over time, to have more disclosure around our SaaS solutions.\nAs of June 30th, we didn't have Spok Go booked and generating revenue. That happened -- the large one happened actually in July. As we go forward, we'll start talking about it. We're generally looking at these bookings with a total contract value over a three-year period.\nIt's a SaaS-based model so it's 36 months. You can figure out how then the revenue would flow in and then that layers and we build it over time. But we are talking -- Mike and his team have worked with Parthenon to look at how you the SaaS business transformation or what metrics and KPIs, etc. are appropriate for it.\nWe've talked to a couple of our shareholders who have given us resources for it and our accounting and finance team have taken that. We've done a lot of research on it and we're working with our auditors on that right now. And we are talking to -- Mike's got another CFO in the industry that's working on something very, very similar to what we're going through, talking to them about it. Because not only is it a new metric for us in terms of how we report and how we'll give guidance, but we have to -- it's very easy when we go sell our new customer and how to look at it.\nBut when we go to an existing customer and we start selling Spok Go to them and they're also paying us maintenance and doing upgrades, there's a whole another level of sophistication you have to go through there and how you go through that transition. We're in the throes of that right now. And today, as I sit here, you know, on the 30th of July, it would not be appropriate for us to provide a lot of detail around that. But I get the fact that you want it, and Mike and his team, trust me, are all over it.\nMike's been through this before. He knows what he's doing and we'll get there. Thank you. OK.\nI don't see any other questions in the queue. I appreciate the two callers that did ask questions. You know, I really want to thank you all for joining us this morning and those who joined us earlier this week. And we look forward to speaking with you again that's when we release our third-quarter results in October.\nLook, everyone, have a great day today. Stay safe and stay healthy.

{"date":"Jan 14, 2021, 1:00 a.m. ET","exchange":"NYSE: TSM","q":"2020-Q4","ticker":"TSM","transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\n[Foreign Speech] Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TSMC's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This is Jeff Su, TSMC's Director of Investor Relations and your host for today.\nTo prevent the spread of COVID-19, TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the Company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. If you are joining us through the conference call, your dial-in lines are in listen-only mode.\nThe format for today's event will be as follows. First, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the fourth quarter 2020, followed by our guidance for the first quarter 2021. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the Company's key messages. Then TSMC's Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will host the Q&A session, where all three executives will entertain your questions.\nAs usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor notice that appears in our press release.\nAnd now, I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full-year 2020. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2021.\nFourth quarter revenue increased 1.4% sequentially in NT terms or 4.4% in US dollar terms, as we saw strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications.\nGross margin increased 0.6 percentage points sequentially to 54%, mainly thanks to cost improvement, partially offset by the margin dilution from 5-nanometer ramp and an unfavorable exchange rate. Our utilization rate in the fourth quarter was at an extremely high-level, partially due to more production output, of which some of the wafers will be shipped in the first quarter.\nTotal operating expenses slightly decreased by TWD2.6 billion, therefore operating margins increased by 1.4 percentage points sequentially to 43.5%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD5.51 and ROE was 31.4%.\nNow, let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, while 7-nanometer and 16-nanometer contributed 29% and 13%, respectively. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 62% of wafer revenue. On a full-year basis, 5-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 8% of 2020 wafer revenue. 7-nanometer was 33% and 16-nanometer was 17%. Advanced technologies accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 50% in 2019.\nNow, moving on to the revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 13% quarter-over-quarter to account for 51% of our fourth quarter revenue. HPC decreased 14% to account for 31%, IoT decreased 13% to account for 7%, automotive increased 27% to account for 3%, digital consumer electronics increased 29% to account for 4%. On a full-year basis, smartphone, HPC and IoT saw strong growth of 23%, 39%, and 28%, respectively. DCE also increased 2%, while auto decreased 7% in 2020. Overall, smartphone accounted for 48% of our 2020 revenue, HPC accounted for 33% and IoT accounted for 8%.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD791 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD29 billion, mainly to -- due to the increase of TWD57 billion in accounts payable and the increase of TWD38 billion in accrued liabilities and others, offset by the decrease of TWD69 billion in short-term loan.\nLong-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD28 billion, mainly as we raised TWD30.5 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.\nOn financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 1 day to 39 days. Days of inventory increased 15 days to 73 days, primarily due to the ramp of leading nodes.\nNow, let me make a few comments on cash flow and capex. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD259 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD89 billion in capex and distributed TWD65 billion for first quarter '20 cash dividend. Short-term loans decreased by TWD67 billion while bonds payable increased by TWD30.5 billion due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD56 billion to TWD660 billion at the end of the quarter. In US dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $3.2 billion.\nNow, let's look at the recap of our performance in 2020. We saw a strong growth in 2020 as our technology leadership position enabled us to capture the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC. Our revenue increased 31.4% in US dollar terms and 25.2% in NT dollar terms to reach TWD1.34 trillion.\nGross margin increased 7.1 percentage points to 53.1%, primarily due to a higher level of capacity utilization and cost improvement. Operating margin increased 7.5 percentage points to 42.3%. Overall, full-year EPS increased 50% to TWD19.97.\nOn cash flow, we spent TWD507 billion in capex while we generated TWD823 billion in operating cash flow and TWD315 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD259 billion in cash dividends in 2020.\nI have finished my financial summary. Now, let's turn to our first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between $12.7 billion and $13 billion, which represents a 1.3% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD27.95, gross margin is expected to be between 50.5% and 52.5%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%. The sequential decline in first quarter gross margin is mainly due to a slightly lower utilization rate in the first quarter, albeit it is still staying at the high-level, as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.\nNow, I would like to talk about the tax rate. We expect our 2020 tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 11%, and this will be equally applied to all four quarters of the year. This concludes my financial presentation.\nNow, I would like to start with the key messages for the quarter. I will start by making some comments on our capital budget in 2020 and 2021. Every year, our capex is invested in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the next few years. Our capital investment decisions are based on four disciplines: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust, and earning the proper return. In 2020, we spent $17.2 billion to capture the strong demand for our advanced technologies and support our customers' capacity needs. In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies and further support of customers' capacity needs, our 2021 capital budget is expected to be between $25 billion and $28 billion. Out of the $25 billion to $28 billion capex for 2021, about 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies.\nNext, let me talk about our capital intensity outlook. As we have said previously, our long-term capital intensity is in the mid-30s percentage range. However, when we enter a period of higher growth, our capex needs to be spent ahead of the revenue growth that will follow, so our capital intensity will be higher. For example, during 2010 to 2014, our capex spending increased threefold as compared to the previous few years and our capital intensity range between 38% to 50%. Because of the increased investment, we were able to capture the growth opportunities and deliver above 15% growth CAGR from 2010 to 2015. Today, as we enter another period of higher growth, we believe a higher level of capacity -- capital intensity is appropriate to capture the future growth opportunities. We now expect a higher growth CAGR in the next few years, driven by the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications, which C.C. will discuss in more detail.\nWe also expect this higher level of capital investment to continue to drive our technology leadership, enable flexible and responsive manufacturing and earn customers' trust. While our leading those capital cost continues to increase due to increasing process complexities, it is expected to be compensated by continuing to sell our value, which includes the value of our technology, service, quality and capacity support and diligently working on cost improvement. With this level of capex spending in 2021, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable cash dividend on both an annual and quarterly basis.\nNow, let me turn the microphone over to C.C.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Wendell. Hi, everyone. This is C.C. Wei. Good afternoon. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time.\nNow, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our fourth quarter with revenue of TWD361.5 billion or $12.7 billion, which was in line with our guidance, mainly due to strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology, driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications. Concluding 2020, the semiconductor industry, excluding memory recourse, was about 10%, while foundry industry increased about 20% year-over-year. TSMC's revenue grew 31.4% year-over-year in US dollar terms.\nMoving into first quarter 2021, our business continues to be shrunk, supported by HPC-related demand, recovery in the automotive segment, and a milder smartphone seasonality gained [Phonetic] in recent years.\nOn the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory was digested throughout the fourth quarter. We now expect it to approach the historical season exiting 2020 better than our forecast three months ago. We observe that the supply chains are changing their approaches to inventory management amid the lingering macro uncertainties. Looking ahead, we expect the supply chain and our customer to prepare a higher level of inventory compared to the historical season level for a longer period of time, given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security.\nNext, let me talk about the automotive supply tightness. The automotive market has been soft since 2018. Entering 2020, COVID-19 further impacted the automotive market. The auto supply chain was affected throughout the year and our customers continued to decrease their demand in the third quarter. We only began to see sudden recovery in the fourth quarter. However, the automotive supply chain is long and complex, where many of our technology nodes has been tight throughout 2020 due to strong demand from our other customers. Therefore, in the near-term, as demand from the automotive supply chain is rebounding, the shortage in automotive supply has become more obvious. In TSMC, this is our top priority and we are working closely with our automotive customer to resolve the capacity support issue.\nNow, I will talk about our 2021 outlook. For the full-year of 2021, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to grow about 8%, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 10%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by mid-teens percentage in 2021 in US dollar term. Our 2021 business will be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and specialty technologies, where we see strong interest from all four growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, automotive and IoT.\nNext, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. We are entering a period of higher growth as the multi-year megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021.\nWe expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance and with a latency improvement of 5G network to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multi-year megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.\nAs we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, and therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in US dollar terms.\nNow, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.\nFinally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.\nThis concluding our key message. Thank you for your attention.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all the participants an opportunity to ask their questions. Should you raise to -- wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate into English before our management answers your question.\n[Operator Instructions] Now, let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed with the first caller on the line.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nYes. The first one to ask question, Gokul Hariharan from J.P. Morgan.\nGokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThank you for taking my question. Happy New Year and fantastic results and guidance. So, let me ask a question first on 3-nanometer. Dr. Wei, how should we think about the size of 3-nanometer? What we have seen is, over the last two years, 28-nanometer was a very big node, 7-nanometer came out to be roughly 70% bigger, if you think about peak revenue, compared to 28-nanometer when you had new applications coming in. How -- given the big capex plan that you are also outlining, should we think that 3-nanometer, once it ramps up fully, would be substantially bigger than 7-nanometer in terms of peak revenues? Just wondering, how we should kind of think about the size of this process node.\nAnd could you also talk a little bit about the opportunities within HPC? Right now you are already engaged with multiple HPC customers, but could you talk a little bit about CPU -- x86 CPU, obviously, which is something on everybody's mind. Could you talk a little bit about how do you think it would be exposed to this market as well as we go into the 3-nanometer era?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Gokul, sorry, this is Jeff. Let me please summarize your questions -- two questions, we'll take them in the -- one by one. Gokul's first question is with regards to 3-nanometer and about the size of our 3-nanometer. He notes that in the past we have had very big nodes, such as 28-nanometer and then 7-nanometer. So, Gokul wants to know in terms of the peak revenue contribution, do we expect or should N3 be substantially bigger than N7. That's his first question. Correct?\nGokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nYeah. Especially considering the step-up in capex as well. Thank you.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Gokul, let me answer your question by saying that we do expect the 3-nanometer will be widely used in HPC-related applications in addition to the smartphones. So, with this kind of engagement with our customer, we do expect our revenue will be bigger, certainly. There's no doubt about it.\nSo, what is the next question?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAnd then, Gokul, I think the second part of your question is looking at what are our opportunities in high-performance computing. Gokul notes that we have multiple customers engaged. But in particular, he is asking about the progress or the status of CPU opportunity and what do we see as the drivers of HPC?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nGokul, we don't specifically name one of our HPC's applications, such as CPU to say that what is the growth rate. But let me tell you that, CPU, networking and AI accelerator will be the main growth area in the HPC applications. Did that answer your question?\nGokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nCould you be a little bit more specific on x86? I mean, you already had good success in 7-nanometer penetrating the x86 market. Should we say -- should we think that the x86 market share continues to move up a lot as we get into 3-nanometer?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Gokul, I guess, the -- your question is really on the x86. And looking at 7-nanometer has done well, as we get into 3-nanometer, will our exposure to x86 continue to increase?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nAgain, we don't specifically comment on very specific area. We work with our customer continuously and to supply the very good technology to support their business.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nGokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThank you. I'll go back into the queue. Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAll right. Thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next person on the line, please?\nOperator\nNext one to ask question, Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse.\nRandy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. Yes. Thank you. I have -- I got two questions to ask. First on the -- you talked about the automotive and I assume also your mature nodes are very tight. You traditionally haven't added that much capacity on mature nodes and 8-inch. Could you discuss what's in that because you have some mix of that, how you're seeing a strategy to add capacity for those nodes? And could you also look at -- auto has been only about 3% of revenue, should we expect a meaningful pickup in this vertical, both the mature applications and also from new areas like EV and ADAS?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Randy, let me summarize your question. You're asking first on the automotive side. He notes our comments that automotive supply is tight. Do we expect a pickup in the automotive vertical? And then, also in looking at the mature nodes, will auto benefit our mature nodes? And then ADAS and other trends in automotive, how do we see?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me say that, now we see the automotive industry need a lot of semiconductor component, and that's including the leading-edge technology for the ADAS system and also some of the mature technology for a lot of applications like sensor, like power management IC. We do see right now a little bit shortage on the automotive, the mature technology supply and we are working with customer to mitigate to show this impact.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAnd then Randy is also asking second part on our mature nodes. Given the tightness, will we consider to add capacity for the mature nodes?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe always work with our customer to plan [Phonetic] our technologies, capacity, all those kind of thing. For mature node, we used to convert some of the large capacity into specialties. Right now, the trend stays the same.\nRandy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. And my second question, it's two parts. Just want to ask on gross margin and inventory. The gross margins you've improved 4 points year-over-year. Part of that utilization, but depreciation also was up 45% NT dollar to get you 6 points. So, could you discuss if you've had a breakthrough on the cost reduction side? And if -- now, I think last quarter you said about 50%. But given what you've seen on cost reduction and coming off 54%, if you could have better confidence on margin, could continue to do better?\nAnd then I'll just ask a quick on inventory. Was it up 15 days? Historically, you draw down within the fourth quarter, but maybe the trend-wise inventory was rising into early in the year.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Randy, let me summarize your questions, two parts. First is on the gross margin. He notes that our gross margin improved throughout the year. And Randy wants to know if there is a breakthrough on the cost side and therefore, the long-term outlook for our gross margin, is it still 50% or not?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nRight. Randy, this is Wendell. You just mentioned that our depreciation increased 45% year-over-year. I think the number should be 15% year-over-year.\nRandy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. I was looking Q4 to Q4, I think that -- just the fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nRight, right. Now, in terms of gross margin in the long-term, we believe 50% gross margin is reasonable and achievable. There are six factors affecting our profitabilities: the ramp of leading-edge technology; price; cost; mix; utilization and foreign exchange rate. Take foreign exchange rate, for example, in 2020, the average dollar against NT rate was TWD29.43. It is now trading between TWD27.90 to TWD28. That is already a 5% appreciation of NT. So, every 1% of appreciation of NT will affect our gross margin by a 40 basis point.\nThe other thing is the -- in the fourth quarter of last year, as we mentioned, the utilization rate was very high, extremely high, and that's -- the abnormal level of high utilization rate cannot sustain. Therefore, in this quarter, we believe the utilization rate will come down a little bit, albeit is still at a very high level. Now, every point of utilization rate change will impact the gross margin by 40 basis point.\nA third example will be the ramp in our leading-edge technologies. We mentioned last time that we expect N5 ramp in 2021 to affect our margins by 2 percentage point to 3 percentage point. And we still think that will be the case. So, if you take all of those into considerations, we believe 50% gross margin is reasonable and achievable in the long-term.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAnd then Randy had also asked about our days of inventory.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nRight.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nIncreasing in fourth quarter.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nRight. And that's partially because some -- as -- we have a very high utilization in the fourth quarter, but some of the wafers will be shipped in the first quarter as opposed to shipped in the fourth quarter.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please?\nOperator\nNext one we have Sebastian Hou from CLSA.\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nThanks gentlemen for taking my questions. Happy New Year. First question is, I want to follow on the gross margin side. So, you've alluded that in the past two quarters the -- your gross margin, actual result turn out to be either at the high-end or at the surprise to the upside to your original guidance. While revenue is much on the high-end of the guidance, while the Taiwan dollars continue to appreciated second half of last year's. So which means that the margin result to be better than what you originally guided for two quarters consecutively. So, my question is, whether or not the 1Q outlook, the margin is too conservative again? And second, that is whether our structural profitability will need to revise up just as our five-year revenue growth has just been revised up officially? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAll right. Sebastian, let me summarize your first question. Your observation that in the past two quarters our gross margin has come in at the high-end or slightly above the high-end of our guidance. Revenue at the high-end and the currency appreciation is there. So, Sebastian is -- question is, first, is the first quarter gross margin guidance too conservative? And what about the outlook for our longer-term structural profitability? Does it need to be revised up?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nOkay. Sebastian, if we compare fourth quarter to first quarter, 54% in the fourth quarter and the mid-term of our guidance for first quarter is 51.5%. The 2.5 percentage point difference, actually mainly come from the utilization, as well as the unfavorable foreign exchange rates. So, at this moment, we are still sticking to this guidance, although obviously, we will work hard to continue to improve the gross margins.\nAs for the long-term gross margin, as I just reported earlier that we are maintaining the 50% gross margin to be reasonable, achievable based on the elements -- the six factors that I just talked about. Each of those factors will affect our profitability in long-term.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Sebastian, do you have a second question?\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nYes, I do. Thanks, Jeff. And thanks, Wendell. My second question is on your capex outlook. Apparently that -- at least that's a significant upside surprise to me and I think also to the consensus estimate. So, the last time I think when the Company raised the capex from $10 billion to $12 billion level to the -- like a $15 billion to $17 billion level, then that resulted in a 30% revenue growth in 2020. And then -- so my question is that, I think the capex we invest for the future growth, so whether or not this -- another step-up with the capex to like -- to $25 billion to $30 billion this year's, will represent an acceleration of the growth in 2022 or 2023? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So Sebastian's question is, looking at our capex guidance for this year, $25 billion to $28 billion, it is above his expectations. So he is looking at the last time, we have an increase in acceleration to capex from $10 billion to $12 billion to $15 billion to $17 billion resulted in us growing 30% this year -- 31% this year. So what is the outlook for our growth in 2022 or the future years?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nOkay. Sebastian, it's too early to talk about -- specifically about 2022. But as C.C. mentioned, in the next five years our target CAGR is between 10% to 15%. So that's already higher than the original target of 5% to 10% CAGR that we used to have before the last conference call. And that's also because of the higher capital investment that we are ready to make to capture the higher growth opportunities underpin that by the multi-year megatrends in the industry.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me add something. This is C.C. Wei. This 10% to 15% CAGR is based on a very high number of 2020. So, we still forecast a 10% to 15% CAGR. That will tell you that how much of capex we need to invest.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you. Thank you, Sebastian.\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nThank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOperator, can we move on to the next caller, please?\nOperator\nNext one we have Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs.\nBruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. Great result and great guidance. I think the big difference is, this time is that, you raised the long-term revenue CAGRs from 5% to 10% to 10% to 15%. Can you tell us that in terms of this kind of incremental changes, how much the growth is coming from HPC and what are the other drivers for that?\nAnd in terms of that smartphone growth, I think the 5G penetration is already like 30-something-percent in 2021. Moving forward, how much growth for you is coming from the dollar content growth or the shipment growth, or can you provide more color on the growth?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Bruce. So your question is really about our long-term growth outlook, with our growth target CAGR of 10% to 15%. Your question basically is by the different platforms such as HPC, what is the growth contribution and in looking at smartphone, how much is dollar content, how much is unit contribution?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me answer the question by -- actually, the growth rate from the HPC application is higher than the corporate average. And smartphone is very close to the corporate and also automotive is higher than the corporate average. IoT close to that corporate average. Did that answer your question?\nBruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nYes. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. My next question is -- I want to ask about structural profitability. I understand that all these six factors for the profitability but that's based on the assumption that structural profitability remain unchanged. So, do we consider to move up the structural profitability because of the current supply -- structural growth for the Company or the structural tightness, especially with legacy technology node?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Bruce, your second question is on the structural profitability. Given the higher growth outlook, and also the tightness in supply at legacy nodes or legacy technologies. Will we consider to move up the structural profitability target?\nBruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nYes.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nBruce, as I just mentioned, we are maintaining the financial objective, i.e., the structural profitability goal of 50% gross margin. And of those six factors, every one of them can affect the profitability. For example -- I'll just use an example in foreign exchange rate, utilization and also the ramp of leading-edge nodes. And, for example, the leading-edge technologies, the complexities increases the capex per K. It's more expensive than before. So we are working very hard with the customer to sell our value, the service value, the technology value and also the capacity value and firm up the wafer pricing. At the same time, we also work very closely with our suppliers to continue to improve our cost, so that altogether we can maintain and earn a proper return in the leading nodes compared to those of the previous few nodes. As a result, we are maintaining our structural profitability goal as 50% of gross margin.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay.\nBruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nSo, understand. Let me clarify that, whatever you gain in terms of your cost saving you will still return it to your customer and maintain your 50% profitability target?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nIt's -- there are six factors, so all -- you add all of them together, it's...\nBruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nUnderstand.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Yeah.\nBruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nI understand. Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next caller on the line, please? Thank you.\nOperator\nNext one to ask question, Charlie Chan, Morgan Stanley. You're on now.\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. Happy New Year. So, first question is also about the capex. So in the past for you to spend huge capex on leading-edge is usually for the smartphone application given that the key user is Apple. So, at this time you almost doubled your capex level, does it means that there is a significant upside to the Intel CPU outsourcing? This is the first question. Thanks.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Charlie. So your question is on our capex basically. Charlie notes that in the past our large capex on leading-edge historically has been for smartphone platform, this year, of course, our capex number is much higher. So, therefore, he is wondering whether it's intended for a particular customer on the CPU side.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Charlie, let me answer the question. In fact, we don't comment on specific customer or specific area. Our capex guidance is based on the current long-term demand profile underpinned by the industry's megatrend.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Charlie?\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYeah.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nDo you have a second question?\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes, I do. So, just some feedback to C.C. I think we all understand the megatrend of 5G and HPC. So the last question was just to understand whether there is additional kind of growth driver, for example, IDM outsourcing on top of the organic growth. But my next question, I think it should be more related to your strategy because I think your existing customer Intel two days ago, they also commented about, don't rule out the possibility of licensing their foundry process. And actually 20 years ago, back in 2000, I think you also licensed the largest semi process to National Semi. And so, I'm not sure if TSMC, after 20 years, do you still kind of consider this kind of option? Does that mean, the license your foundry process to your IDM customer or even consider some option like a joint venture for this type [Phonetic] operation with your IDM customer? Thanks.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, again, we don't comment on the specific topics or specific customer. But let me tell you that we are working with our customer continuously and -- to expand the TSMC's business and to support our customers' demand.\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOkay. Okay. Got you. So, I will get back to the queue. I have some follow-up. Thanks.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nThanks, Charlie. All right. Operator, let's move on to the next person on the line, please.\nOperator\nNext to ask question, Brett Simpson from Arete Research.\nBrett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst\nYeah. Thanks very much. Questions maybe first for Wendell. So, on the revenue guide, I guess, you're starting the year with a far better than seasonal Q1. But I just wondered, how do you see the year playing out. Should we expect in the second half a typical seasonality this year?\nAnd then, in terms of the capex guide for this year, obviously, there is a big step-up. And spending this year is normally a reflection of how you think about future capacity growth beyond 2021. So, can we assume from the big increase in capex this year that your implied revenue growth in 2022 would be -- will be higher than 2021? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Brett has two questions, one on the revenue guidance. We guided for mid-teens for the full-year -- growth for 2021. So he wants to know how does it play out throughout the year? Is there -- second half, will we see the typical seasonality first half, second half split? That's his first question.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. From what we can see, second half is still higher than the first half.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAnd then the second part is also capex and growth. Looking at the increase in our capex investment in 2021, noting that we typically spend capex in advance of the growth that will follow. Brett wants to know then should we expect a big year or a large growth year in 2022, sorry?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nBrett, it's -- as I said, it's a bit too early to discuss 2022 in details. But C.C. just mentioned, over the next five years, we're looking at the higher range of CAGR. And also, the capex spend this year means future opportunity in growth, not just for the next year, but also the years after that. So, we are looking at multiple years of growth opportunities.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nBrett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst\nAnd maybe just one for C.C. Wei on N3. You mentioned N3 would have the best PPA and we're seeing a lot of transistor innovation at Intel and Samsung in the next couple of years, but you're planning to stick with FinFET at 3-nanometer. And I'm just wondering how you see the transistor density at 3-nanometer. I think at N5 you've talked about 175 million transistors per mill square is the potential of N5. How should we think about N3 in that regard, and relative to some of the transistor innovation we're seeing at Intel and Samsung, are you happy with the FinFET roadmap? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Brett. So your second question is regards to our N3 and our decision to continue to use FinFET transistor structure at 3-nanometer. You note that at 5-nanometer we can deliver about 175 million transistors per millimeter square. So you want to know how this falls out at N3, or maybe in terms of our 3-nanometer in comparison to Samsung or others, how does it compare?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, as I said in my statement, that N3 still provide 70% of the logic density gain in addition to all the performance gain, and the power reductions. Whether that's at 5-nanometer you got 175 million transistor per millimeter square, that's a lot depends on what the number in N3. I think that a lot depend on customers design. We continue to say that we offer the FinFET because of the technology maturity, the performance and the cost, are the best combination for TSMC to serve our customer.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, Brett.\nBrett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst\nThank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nThanks. Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please?\nOperator\nNext one we have Roland Shu from Citigroup.\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon. Congrats on a very good result. My first question is also for the capex spending. And there are two parts of my question. So, based on your sharply increased capex spending, are you considering to sign long-term contracts with customers, especially to those customers who are new to adopt your most leading-edge technology to ensure a proper return of your investment?\nAnd second part of the question is, if this let you have spend ahead in capex EUV because on your -- the lower productivity for EUV when you first ran EUV? So I would like to know how much capex downside you expect after you have improved EUV productivity to the optimized level? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Roland, we will take your questions one by one. Both of them relate to capex. First one is that, with the higher level of capex that we have in 2021, Roland wants to know that would we consider signing long-term contracts with customers, especially with customers that are new to TSMC, to ensure that we are making a proper return?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nRoland, sign a contract to guarantee the loading in the future is not our common practice. We always work with our customer and continuously work with customer to serve their demand. And we also put our capex or expanding our capacity according to our current long-term demand forecast, all right? And did that answer your question?\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay. Yeah. Yeah. I think it did.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Roland. And then your second question is also related to capex. Roland, let me summarize. I think you're saying that in our capex guidance, your assumption that the lower productivity of EUV means leading to a higher capex level for TSMC. So your question is that, if the productivity -- as the productivity of EUV improves, then will -- how much reduction in capex could we see? Is that your question? Am I summering that correctly?\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nYes, exactly. Yeah. Exactly. Thanks.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me answer that. We continue to improve the EUV's productivity because we are working closely with suppliers. And so far we -- the improvement is obvious, but it's still not up to our expectation yet. As for the capex will be decreased because of improved productivity, this is in our capex plan already.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay. So, means for going forward, I mean, even you have higher EUV productivity, the capex spending or capex -- capital intensity probably will be still high this year, or in the near future?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Roland, his question is that, even with EUV productivity and factoring into our capex that our capital intensity could remain high even into next year.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, the capex remained high or the capex intensity remained high is because of technology complexity. It's actually that N5 is much more complicated than N7, N3 much more complicated than N5. So, most of that capex intensity coming from this technology advancement. Of course, EUV is a part of it, but it's not the only one reason.\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay. Okay. Then my second question [Speech Overlap]\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you. Roland, I think that's two questions already, sorry, because we still have several people in the queue. I would kindly ask you to get back into the queue, so we can allow everyone a chance. Thank you.\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAll right. Operator, let's move on to the next caller on the line, please.\nOperator\nYeah. The next one we have Sunny Lin from UBS.\nSunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is that, I want to follow-up on 3-nanometer. I think -- just want to get a bit of color on your current visibility for the customer adoption into second half of next year. How does it compare with the historical ramp of 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer? And also the cost per transistor for 3-nanometer versus 5? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Sunny. So your first question is on 3-nanometer, you want to know the visibility into customer adoption of 3-nanometer into second half 2022 and how does it compare to 5-nanometer or prior nodes, and also the cost per transistor at 3-nanometer, is it still declining?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nLet me answer that. The cost per transistor actually start continue to decrease. But for your question about engagement, we said the customer -- we see a lot of customer, especially from the HPC field, they are engaged with their activity with TSMC.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay? Sunny, do you have a second question?\nSunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst\nRight. So just a very quick follow-up to my first question. Wonder if C.C. would be able to provide any color regarding the ramp for 3-nanometer for second half of next year. Thank you very much.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt's early adoption from our customer is both in the smartphone and HPC-related applications. That's all I can say.\nSunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you. And then my second question is for your 2021 gross margin. So, with capex going up significantly, how should we think about your depreciation growth for this year and also the impact on gross margin? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Sunny's second question is on the 2021 overall gross margin. With a higher level of capex spending, she wants to know what will be the year-on-year increase in depreciation and what's the impact to the overall 2021 gross margin?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nSunny, the depreciation in 2021 is expected to be between mid- to high-20s higher than 2020. And the impact of -- to gross margins, well, it's too early to talk about the remaining quarters of 2021. But as a general feeling, you look at the capacity utilization that I just mentioned, foreign exchange rate are favorable and also the N5 ramp negative impact on our profitability, those are the factors that may affect our all year 2021 gross margins. But as I said, it's too early to talk about details on the remaining quarters.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nSunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you very much. Very helpful.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nSure. Thank you, Sunny. All right. Operator, let's move on to the next caller, please.\nOperator\nRight now we are having Laura Chen from KGI. Go ahead, please.\nLaura Chen -- KGI Securities -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations for the good result and outlook. I also have a question about the capex and the gross margin trend. I think given your strong position in the most advanced technology nodes and extremely high capex in recent years, I believe there must be some strong conviction on the outlook with your major clients. So, can you share with us your view that for the N3 first year contribution will be similar to N5 that we'll have probably more than 10% revenue for the first year mass production? Can we expect that to happen?\nAnd also on the gross margin side, given there might be some swing factor of your major IDM clients for outsourcing opportunity, how would you manage the deterioration rate, which may impact your gross margin substantially? That's my first question. Thanks.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Laura, I think that's two questions. But your first question is on the N3, sort of noting our strong position in the advanced nodes, and also the higher capex as an indication of the strong conviction of major clients. Laura wants to know what -- will the revenue contribution of 3-nanometer in its first year be similar to -- or how does it compare to 5-nanometer in the first year?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nOkay. Laura, it's really too early to talk about that at this moment. But as C.C. said, we believe N3 when it's out, it's going to be another large and lasting nodes for TSMC.\nLaura Chen -- KGI Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. Got it. Thanks. And also on the -- probably the swing factor of the utilization rate that may impact the gross margin potentially on the -- and particularly for advanced node, how should we look at the trend? How will you manage that?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Laura's second question is looking at our gross margin and then also looking at opportunities, for example, in a particular IDM, if there are swings in utilization, how would we manage that and how would that impact the gross margin? Is that correct, Laura?\nLaura Chen -- KGI Securities -- Analyst\nYes. Thank you.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nWe don't -- Laura, we don't comment on specific customers or business outlook. The -- what we can say is, we continue to work with our customers closely and to ensure that we provide this proper capacity to them and we also maintain a good utilization out of it.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAnd as Wendell --. Yeah.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nLaura, let me add some colors. I think our business has been driven in the past few years by smartphones. Starting from this year on, the HPC also jump on the wagons. And therefore, we looking -- forward looking, we see the traditional seasonality can be moderated with multiple big customer in multiple market segments. So that's our confidence. The other confidence is, our capex includes 3-nanometer, also 5-nanometer. Our 5-nanometer is also very strong, stronger than we expected three months ago. So those two combined to give us the confidence to increase our capex.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Laura?\nLaura Chen -- KGI Securities -- Analyst\nThat's very helpful. Yeah. Thank you very much. That's very helpful.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you, Laura. Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please?\nOperator\nNext one we have Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank.\nRobert Sanders -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nYeah, hi. I've just got one question actually. Just could you please comment more on the wafer shortage situation and how severe it is at present? Which nodes are you seeing the shortage most acute? Is it 65, 90-nanometer, 0.11, 0.13, whatever it is? And how far are you essentially booked out at some of these nodes? And do you think there is -- upside to wafer pricing of these nodes? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Robert, your question is on the tightness or shortage in the wafer. He is asking, is it at particular nodes such as 65-nanometer and 90-nanometer, 0.13, how short it is and how long it will last?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nRobert, most of the shortage actually is in the mature node. It's not in the 3 -- not in the 5 or 7-nanometer per se. But in all the mature node, especially in 0.13 [Phonetic] micron, 40-nanometer, and 55-nanometer, in those areas.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nRobert Sanders -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nCan I just follow-up with -- one follow-up, which is just -- you haven't traditionally built capacity there, but they could become part dependencies for the industry if they are continuing to be short. So, would you actually consider building greenfield to help the industry or you think that other foundries will handle that?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nSo, Robert, your follow-up question is then, given the shortage or tightness on some of these mature nodes, will we consider to expand, build new capacity at these mature nodes to alleviate any potential bottleneck risk?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, actually, we are working with customer closely and moving some of their mature node to more advanced node where we have better capacity to support them. In addition to that, we also try to manage this shortage condition, try to mitigate the impact from this shortage.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nRobert Sanders -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThanks a lot.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you. Operator, let's move on to the next caller, please.\nOperator\nNext one we have Rick Hsu from Daiwa Securities.\nRick Hsu -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst\nYeah. Hi, Happy New Year, guys. This is Rick. My first question is, I guess, you guys mentioned that now your customers are happy living with a higher inventory than the historical pattern because of the macro uncertainties with COVID-19. So, I wonder if your customers would still be happy living with a higher inventory than the normal historical patterns, if the virus -- if COVID-19 is contained. This is my first question.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, Rick. So your question is, our -- the higher level of inventory that we are seeing partly is attributable to COVID-19. What if COVID-19 is no longer -- everyone has vaccine and is no longer an issue, will this continue?\nRick Hsu -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst\nThat is correct.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. First, they say that we really hope that the vaccine will work, and -- but even it is working, it takes time and then also our customers still at this -- today, they still have a different approach for the inventory management as we said, because of the secure of the supply is more important than anything else in today's situation. So we don't think it's really to revert back to the historical level of the inventory.\nRick Hsu -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you. That's helpful. My second question is also regarding your capex because the number this year is really high. So, about 80% of your Tai capex this year is going to be spent for leading-edge. So, I wonder how much of that portion is actually for preparation of the capacity built for 2022 and be -- not for this year. So, can you share your idea with us?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Rick, your question is on our capex. 80% -- about 80% is for the advanced nodes. He wants to know how much of this spending for the advanced nodes is in preparation for capacity for 2000 -- sorry, 2022.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nRick, we invest this year actually for future year primarily. So, it's not only for 2022. It may also be for the years following that. So that's -- I think that's something that I would like to share with you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nRick Hsu -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you so much.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nNo problem. Thank you, Rick. Okay. Operator, let's move on to the next caller.\nOperator\nNext one we have Andrew Lu from Sinolink Securities.\nAndrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst\nGood morning. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Can you hear me?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nYes. We can hear you.\nAndrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. My first question is, if your customer has its own design rule nodes with different metal and poly pitch spec from TSMCs one. Can this customer use a in-house manufacturing in TSMC foundry based on the same design or it needs to redesign the chip-based on TSMC 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer design rule?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Andrew, let me try to summarize your question. Your question is about our customers' design rules. If the customer has their own design rules, but with different metal and different poly pitch from TSMCs, could this customer use TSMC foundry or use the in-house manufacturing, or do they need to use TSMCs design rules basically?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nAndrew, we always work closely with our customer to support their design into TSMC's process technologies. So, we can manufacture inside TSMC.\nAndrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst\nSo customer doesn't need to change its own design?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. I cannot answer this question because of -- it's two parties cooperation. And as I said, we work closely with them to support their design.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nAndrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst\nUnderstood. My second question is, since our 3-nanometer, 4-nanometer nodes work you're ramping out next year. What about second half this year? Will we have something like 5-nanometer plus or revision in 5-nanometer process node for second half this year? Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Andrew, second question is looking at second half of this year, noting that next year will have, for example, N3 and N4, then second half of this year, do we have any new node or continuous improvement -- enhancement?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nAndrew, we always continue to improve the technologies. Last year, we introduced our 5-nanometer to the market. This year, we continue to improve it and next year we will improve further. So we never stop.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nAndrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst\nSo something like a 5-nanometer plus.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nThat's what you are naming, Yes.\nAndrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, Andrew. Let's move on to the next caller, please.\nOperator\nNext one we have Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group, LLP -- Analyst\nYes. Thanks for taking my question. First question has to do with the revenue mix forecast for Q1 by technology and platform. It would be great if you could provide some color. And I have a follow-up.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Mehdi wants to know for the first quarter, revenue by technology and revenue by platform.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nOkay. Mehdi, in the first quarter, HPC, automotive, and IoT will increase sequentially, while smartphone will experience a milder seasonal decline compared to its recent seasonalities.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAnd we do not provide a breakdown guidance of revenue by technology, Mehdi. Okay? So, do you have a second question?\nMehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group, LLP -- Analyst\nYes. Just a quick follow-up on capex. Does your $25 billion to $28 billion capex guide include investment for infrastructure in US?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nSo, Mehdi's question is, does our capex guidance this year include any investment for the US fab infrastructure?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, it does. The US fab starts construction this year.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nMehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group, LLP -- Analyst\nCan you elaborate how much of the capex is for US?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nNot at this point, right.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, Mehdi.\nMehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group, LLP -- Analyst\nAll right. Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nThanks. Operator, let's move on to the next caller.\nOperator\nNext one, Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nYeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also had two on capex. Number one, pretty nice step up in capex this year from last year. Is it fair to assume your investment in EUV is also up this year relative to last year? And then I had a follow-up.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So Krish's first question is that, with our increase in capex guidance -- that we guided for in 2021 versus 2020 being an increase, does that also mean an increase in the capex we spend on EUV?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nNo, we do not disclose that details.\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. And then as a follow-up, C.C., you mentioned that how capital intensity is going to be high all the way through 3-nanometer, but you also said long-term capital intensity should be in the mid-30s. So I'm just trying to square that by -- what do you mean by long-term? Because it looks like if the 3-nanometer is still going to be high in the next few years, capital intensity might be higher than mid-30s. So at what point should we expect it to get to mid-30s?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So Krish's second question is in terms of capital intensity, with the capital intensity or capex per K at 3-nanometer being higher, and then we have the long-term capital intensity returning to mid-30s. He wants to know when will we return to mid-30s capital intensity level? Is that correct, Krish?\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nYes. Thank you, Jeff. Yes.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We mean long-term meaning three to five years. I think 2010 to 2014 can be an example. During that period of time, the capital intensity rose from 38% to 50%, maintaining at high-40s for a couple of years and came down afterwards. Something like that should be a reference.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nThank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAll right. Thanks, Krish. Operator, let's move on to the next caller, please.\nOperator\nNext one, Gokul Hariharan, J.P. Morgan.\nGokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up question. One question on capex and depreciation. Do we -- are we having to spend capex a little bit ahead of what we used to spend in past in the EUV era? Is that all -- is that the function of having to spend maybe six to nine months ahead compared to, let's say, in the immersion era? That's one.\nAnd how should we think about depreciation with this jump in capex? Wendell, could you give us a little bit of guidance in terms of how we should think about depreciation for this year and going ahead as well given the heightened level of capex?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Gokul, let me summarize. Your first question is in terms of the capex. He wants to know that, are we -- with capex, are we having to spend capex earlier now and is this because of EUV that we need to spend more capex earlier?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me answer the question. The answer is yes, because of there is a long lead time for the EUV tools. The tools are very complicated and the supply chain for the EUV takes long time to prepare for it. And as a result, TSMC also had to plan in advance. That's longer than the normal tools we used to have.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. And then Gokul, second question is looking at with the higher capex, the depreciation outlook.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nRight. For this year, Gokul, we expect the depreciation to increase by mid-20% to high-20% for 2021 over 2020.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay, Gokul?\nGokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOkay. And maybe just add -- yeah. So even with that, we are comfortable with the 50% structural gross margin?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nSo, even with the higher growth in depreciation, Gokul is asking, are we still comfortable with the 50% gross margin?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. 50% gross margin as a long-term target we think it's reasonable and achievable.\nGokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThank you. Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay? Operator, in the interest of time, I think we'll take the last two callers. So, can we proceed with the next caller on the line?\nOperator\nOkay. The next caller is Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse.\nRandy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. Yeah. Thank you. My first follow-up on US and China, your overseas sites. For the US site, you bought 1,100 acres. Do you have plans to build out a mega fab or potential to build out multi-phase of 20,000 wafers? And then for the China business for Huawei, where it's down to single digits, how is your outlook for the China and also expansion of the China from 20,000?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Randy, your first question is regards to capacity and fab expansion overseas. So, Randy is asking in the US, in Arizona, we target 20,000. Do we -- will we continue to build it out into a mega fab-type of site? And he also wants to know in China, and I guess, you're referring to Nanjing, do we have plans to further expand the capacity in Nanjing? Is that your question, correct, Randy?\nRandy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nYeah. That's the question, just the outlook to rebound China just post-HiSilicon where it's down to mid-single-digit contribution.\nMark Liu -- Chairman\nYeah. This is Mark. Let me take your question. Yeah. We recently acquired a big piece of land in Phoenix, 1,100 acres. Definitely that was the long-term plan to have a mega-scale production sites. But currently our plan is only work on the Phase I production -- I'm talking 2024 with 20,000 wafer per month. And we'll -- going forward we will see, according to the market condition and the cost economics provided by the government support to mend the cost differences to decide the next steps.\nOn China, yes, we do have plan to continue expand in China. But, of course, the business in China after leading-edge will -- does have a reset, but we do expect the demand in China will continue and we will gradually, accordingly, increase our capacity in Nanjing.\nRandy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. Okay, great. And my second question, if you could give -- I think you gave first quarter, but the full-year growth for each of the platforms? And also for the back-end where you're doubling capex, what's leading that investment between the InFO, CoWoS, SoIC in growth outlook for back-end?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Randy is asking about 2021 growth -- first growth outlook by platform and then growth outlook by the back-end, and then, between the back-end InFO, CoWoS by segment.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Randy, for 2021 by platform, we think HPC and automotive growth will be higher than the corporate average growth. Smartphone and IoT will be similar to the corporate average growth in US dollar terms.\nIn terms of our back-end business, we expect it to grow slightly higher than the corporate in 2021. We do not disclose details within the back-end business.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nRandy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank a lot.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAll right. Thanks, Randy.\nRandy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nYeah. Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Operator, can we move on to -- in the interest of time the last caller then?\nOperator\nOkay. The next one we have Sebastian Hou from CLSA.\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nYeah. Thank you. I'm pretty lucky to be the last one and ask again. Thank you. Two follow-up. The first follow-up is, to follow on Mark's comments that -- I think Mark said that the Company has noted its 5-nanometer demand also stronger than you thought three months ago. So, any [Phonetic] value if you can give us more details about which applications are you seeing as stronger-than-expected demand?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nHigh-performance computing.\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nSo for high-performance computing is the typical those -- consumer electronics or is more typical HPC or blockchain-related?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nSorry, I didn't hear the -- we didn't hear the last part, Sebastian. Your...\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nYeah. I'm sorry. I think that the -- for the HPC part, is it more related to your existing customers or more related to the blockchain-related products?\nMark Liu -- Chairman\nOh, let me just add a little bit color on this. High-performance computing as Wendell just said will be the major growth driver of our business. And this field is currently under exciting changes. The high-performance computing's architectures, as you know, from different customers, everybody is striving to get the best performance with different architectures. So many, many -- many more players is getting into this field. So, we see a stronger innovation is coming our way on N3, as well as on N5. Yeah.\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nOkay. Okay. That's great. Thank you.\nMark Liu -- Chairman\nIt's not on cryptocurrency, Sebastian. We don't count on that, but we support that. Yeah.\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nOkay. Yeah. That's fair. And the second follow-up is for -- to Wendell's comment on that. I think this year's -- based on the guidance that we will see the capex intensity to go up to 50%. So, if we calculate -- based on the revenue guidance, if we do some calculations, which means the free cash flow for this year could be -- the growth will likely to be -- will be pretty small or even flat, depends on how things go, but definitely not as strong as past few years. So, my question is that, is the Company still sticking to the dividend policy that 70% of free cash flow?\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. So, Sebastian, your question is then in looking at the capex, looking at our revenue guidance, the capital intensity this year been about -- around 50%, then the free cash flow growth may slow this year. So, what is the outlook for the dividend? Do we still use 70% of free cash flow as the cash dividend formula?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nRight. Sebastian, our dividend policy has two parts, 70% of free cash flow, but not to be lower than the previous periods. So we remain committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend. During the periods of higher investment, the focus will be more on sustainable. And as we harvest the growth, the focus will be on steadily increasing.\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nOkay. So thanks, Wendell. So, given that you're paying the -- investors getting the dividend in this quarter and -- which is that earnings you made like three quarters earlier, so if we do the calculation simulation, which means that in the next 24 months the investor will probably still getting the TWD2.5 per quarter. Is that a fair calculation assumption?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nIt's at least, at least.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay?\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nOkay.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nAll right. Thanks, Sebastian.\nSebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst\nYeah, OK. Thank you.\nJeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within four hours from now. The transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.\nSo, thank you for joining us today.

{"date":"Feb 11, 2021, 8:30 a.m. ET","exchange":"NYSE: MYOV","q":"2020-Q3","ticker":"MYOV","transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nGood day, everyone, and welcome to Myovant Sciences third quarter of fiscal-year 2020 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, vice president of investor relations at Myovant. Please go ahead.\nRyan Crowe -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today for a general business update and to review the financial results of Myovant's third quarter of fiscal-year 2020. Joining me for today's call are Dave Marek, Myovant's chief executive officer, Frank Karbe, president and chief financial officer; Adele Gulfo, interim chief commercial officer; and Dr. Juan Camilo Arjona, chief medical officer.\nIn addition to the press release issued earlier this morning, the slides that will be presented during today's webcast are available on our Investor Relations website, investors.myovant.com. During the course of this conference call, we'll be making forward-looking statements. These include plans and expectations with respect to our products, product candidates, strategies, opportunities, and financials, all of which involve certain assumptions of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A discussion of these risks can be found in our SEC disclosure documents.\nIn addition, Myovant does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave Marek, Myovant's chief executive officer. Dave? \nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Since our last earnings report in November, I'm pleased to report that Myovant has achieved four landmark milestones: an FDA approval, a collaboration agreement with Pfizer, positive data from a Phase 3 extension study, and a product launch. These are huge milestones that have helped transform us into a commercial-stage company with compelling near-term opportunities in oncology and women's health. Before we review these milestones in more detail, let me first comment on the ORGOVYX launch.\nIt's still early days, but I'm encouraged by the initial feedback we've heard from the field and the ordering trends we've seen after just five weeks. Through the end of last week, approximately 1,800 bottles of ORGOVYX have been shipped into our distribution channels, which include our specialty distributors, specialty pharmacies, and our free-trial program. We will learn more about this inventory and how it's being dispensed to patients as we receive more patient and provider-level detail and data in the coming weeks. From a customer standpoint, I'm pleased that 10 of our top 20 highest priority accounts have placed at least one order for ORGOVYX.\nAnd overall, of customers that have placed an order through the end of last week, 30% have already placed reorders. So in summary, great progress in the early days of the launch, but we're just getting started. In December last year, the FDA approved ORGOVYX, our oral relugolix monotherapy, 120-milligram tablet for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. As the first and only approved oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, we believe ORGOVYX is poised to become the new androgen deprivation standard of care, and this is based on its differentiated clinical profile, coupled with its patient preferred oral formulation.\nAnd prostate cancer represents a substantial opportunity to improve or redefine care. It is the second most common type of cancer in men in the United States with approximately 3 million men living with this disease. And of those, approximately 300,000 patients are projected to receive androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, this year alone. And of those patients, approximately 100,000 patients will initiate ADT this year, and about 200,000 continuing ADT as part of their prostate cancer treatment journey.\nAnd due to advances in prostate cancer care and an aging population, the number of men with advanced prostate cancer in the U.S. is expected to grow by mid-single digits annually in the coming years. Also, two out of three men with prostate cancer have cardiovascular risk factors, and an estimated 30% of prostate cancer patients have diagnosed cardiovascular disease. So in fact, more men with prostate cancer die of cardiovascular disease than from prostate cancer itself.\nAnd it's well recognized that injectable LHRH agonists, such as leuprolide, the current ADT standard of care, as well as certain other prostate cancer medicines may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. The approval of ORGOVYX now offers men with advanced prostate cancer rapid, profound, and sustained testosterone suppression, and this is without an initial surge in testosterone levels that can exacerbate clinical symptoms known as a hormonal flare. And for men who received time-limited treatment courses and who would benefit from faster return-to-normal testosterone levels, ORGOVYX offers testosterone recovery within 90 days of treatment discontinuation for the majority of men. One of the clinical attributes providers have told us they find most compelling is that men treated with ORGOVYX in the Phase 3 HERO study had a lower incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes, and death from any cause, compared to those receiving LHRH agonist injections.\nAnd finally, as a one-pill, once-a-day therapy, ORGOVYX provides a convenient alternative for patients compared to the injectable options which require travel to the clinic or hospital for administration. So as you can imagine, this is particularly important for this population of patients with advanced prostate cancer during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Now let's briefly review the Myovant-Pfizer collaboration that was announced shortly after the ORGOVYX FDA approval. In December, Myovant and Pfizer entered a broad collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize ORGOVYX and relugolix combination tablet in the U.S.\nand in Canada. Together, we believe we will maximize the benefit relugolix can bring to patients across therapeutic areas and across markets. We'll evenly split relugolix-associated profits and certain development and commercialization expenses in the U.S. and Canada.\nIn exchange for these co-development and co-commercialization rights, Myovant is eligible to receive up to $4.2 billion of net payments from Pfizer. Additionally, Pfizer obtained an exclusive option to develop and commercialize relugolix in oncology outside the U.S. and Canada, excluding certain Asian countries. So let me highlight more specifically the deal economics.\nWe entered into this transaction because we believe it's good for patients, and it creates significant incremental value for Myovant. Adding Pfizer's capabilities to our own has the potential to significantly increase the value of the relugolix franchise by accelerating product uptake and increasing overall peak revenue. The partnership will also allow us to maximize the clinical potential for relugolix while reducing Myovant's cash burn through the sharing of certain expenses. The substantial deal economics dramatically strengthens our current financial condition and significantly improve Myovant's financial outlook, and this will now enable us to invest in our pipeline beyond relugolix sooner than we previously planned.\nIn addition to the $650 million upfront payment, Myovant could also receive additional payments of up to $250 million within the next 18 months. This could be composed of up to $200 million of regulatory milestones for FDA approvals in women's health as well as a $50 million payment that would be triggered should Pfizer exercise its option to develop and commercialize rights to relugolix in oncology outside the U.S. and Canada. And this is a decision we anticipate Pfizer will make during the first half of this year.\nMyovant is also eligible to receive up to $3.5 billion of tiered sales milestones equally split between ORGOVYX and oncology and relugolix combination tablet in women's health based on annual net revenues for each product in the U.S. and Canada. Myovant and Pfizer will also split 50-50 certain relugolix-associated development and commercialization expenses. This will enable us to reduce our anticipated cash burn compared to developing and commercializing relugolix by ourselves.\nSo in summary, the significantly increased value of the relugolix franchise that we anticipate from the collaboration, coupled with the rich deal economics, is expected to more than offset the 50-50 profit split, resulting in greater overall value for Myovant. I'll now turn the call over to Juan Camilo to discuss the recent SPIRIT extension results and to share some exciting details on a near-term life cycle opportunity, relugolix combination tablet. Juan Camilo?\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nThank you, Dave. Last month, we reported the 52-week results for the SPIRIT extension study in women with endometriosis. These results built on the positive 24-week data from the SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 Phase 3 trials we presented last year. SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 had identical designs and enrolled women with moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis surgically diagnosed in the last 10 years.\nApproximately 1,250 women were enrolled across both studies and were randomized one to one to one into three groups to receive placebo for 24 weeks, relugolix combination therapy once daily for 24 weeks, or relugolix monotherapy for 12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of relugolix combination therapy. This last group allowed us to compare the safety of relugolix combination therapy with that of relugolix alone over the first 12 weeks of treatment. The two co-primary endpoints, defined as the proportion of women with a clinically meaningful reduction in dysmenorrhea or menstrual pain and a clinically meaningful reduction in non-menstrual pelvic pain, both assessed by a numerical rating scale, were analyzed after 24 weeks of treatment and compared the relugolix combination and placebo groups. Following the 24-week treatment period, patients were given the option to enroll in an extension study for up to 80 additional weeks with an initial analysis of efficacy and safety at week 52.\nAnother analysis will be conducted at week 104 about one year from now. A total of 802 women enrolled in the extension study, all of whom received relugolix combination therapy, regardless of their treatment assignments in SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2. Let's first review the 24-week results of the SPIRIT studies. As you can see from the data in the orange columns over 24 weeks, relugolix combination therapy demonstrated significant and very consistent efficacy results in both SPIRIT studies with a responder rate for dysmenorrhea of about 75%; responder rate for non-menstrual pelvic pain of over 60%; an improvement in dyspareunia, or painful intercourse, a key secondary endpoint.\nWomen receiving relugolix combination therapy had minimal, non-clinically meaningful bone mineral density loss and a low incidence of hot flashes. So with these results in context, we present on the right side of the table the results from the elagolix monotherapy pivotal studies called Elaris 1 and Elaris 2. While these studies have all similar designs, let me remind you that comparing data from different studies must always be done with caution. As you can see, after 24 weeks, relugolix combination therapy has an efficacy profile comparable to that of the high dose of elagolix with a safety and tolerability profile more like that of the low dose of elagolix.\nLet's now review the 52-week results of the SPIRIT long-term extension study for those women who received relugolix combination therapy for one year. The 52-week results for this group are consistent with the efficacy and safety profile initially observed through 24 weeks. 85% and 73% of women, respectively, reported clinically meaningful reductions in dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain at one year. Importantly, bone mineral density loss was minimal and not clinically meaningful after 24 weeks stabilized from week 24 to week 52.\nThe proportion of patients reporting hot flashes after one year was also consistent with the initial 24-week treatment period despite an observation period that was twice as long. Now let's consider these results in comparison to the results from the 52-week extension study for elagolix monotherapy, which are displayed on the right side of the table. Once again, comparing data from different studies must always be done with caution. Results after one year of treatment suggest that relugolix combination therapy has an efficacy profile comparable to or slightly better than that of the high dose of elagolix with a safety and tolerability profile that is comparable to or slightly better than that of the low dose of elagolix.\nGiven the SPIRIT extension data generated after one year, we believe a relugolix combination tablet, a one-pill, once-a-day treatment, has the potential to be a best-in-class option for women within endometriosis. I'd like to use this opportunity to share with you a new clinical study we plan to initiate in the coming weeks that we believe will provide valuable information to women and their healthcare providers and could further differentiate relugolix combination tablet from other GnRH antagonist treatment options for uterine fibroids and endometriosis. We learn from market research that contraception is important to women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis. Approximately 65% of current uterine fibroid patients taking oral contraceptives for treatment believe that contraception is an important factor in considering a uterine fibroid treatment.\nSimilarly, approximately 78% of women taking elagolix as a treatment for endometriosis believe that contraception is an important treatment consideration. Currently available GnRH antagonist therapies for uterine fibroids and endometriosis require concomitant use of barrier or nonhormonal contraceptives and their use with hormonal contraceptives may be associated with decreased efficacy and increased risk of adverse events. Relugolix combination therapy has already demonstrated 100% ovulation inhibition in Phase 1, open-label, single-arm study in 67 healthy women over an 84-day treatment period. Based on these results, we are planning to start the SERENE study, a Phase 3 study to assess the contraceptive efficacy of relugolix combination tablet.\nThe SERENE study will enroll sexually active healthy women ages 18 to 35 years with presumed normal fertility. All women will receive once-daily relugolix combination tablet for 13 28-day cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the Pearl index, defined as the number of on-treatment pregnancies per 100 women-years of treatment. Positive data from the SERENE study could further differentiate relugolix combination tablet by potentially adding the benefit of prevention of pregnancy for women being treated for uterine fibroids or endometriosis, if approved for these indications.\nWe believe that relugolix combination tablet, which combines 40 milligrams of relugolix with 1 milligram of estradiol and 0.5 milligram of the progestin norethindrone acetate, could have a meaningful impact in the field of women's health. We have heard from prescribers, primarily OB\/GYNs, that they are still looking for better medical treatment options for endometriosis and uterine fibroids as an alternative to surgery. Their top priorities for treatment are very clear and consistent: stop the symptoms, minimize the side effects and make it easy for them and their patients. We believe that relugolix combination tablet has the potential to meet those treatment requirements based on the results from our Phase 3 LIBERTY and SPIRIT clinical studies.\nSymptom relief was significant in these studies with a 90% average reduction in menstrual blood loss in women with uterine fibroids and an 83% average reduction in menstrual pain for women with endometriosis both after one year. Relugolix was generally well tolerated with stable bone mineral density at one year after an initial minimal loss following treatment initiation and rates of adverse events, such as hot flashes, were low and not meaningfully different from placebo. Finally, dosing for relugolix combination tablet is convenient, one pill, once a day with combination therapy from the start, and is the same for uterine fibroids and endometriosis. We believe we may have found the right balance with relugolix combination tablet, reducing estrogen levels to a range that improved symptoms while minimizing the side effect of low estrogen.\nAnd we look forward to potential of bringing this product to women with uterine fibroids later this year, pending the FDA's decision, which we expect by June 1st. I will now turn the call over to Adele to discuss the launch of ORGOVYX. Adele?\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nThank you, Juan Camilo. It has certainly been an exciting first month of our promotional efforts. After our launch meeting just five weeks ago, we are already receiving tremendous prescriber interest and feedback which lead us to believe that ORGOVYX has the potential to be everything we hoped. Our long-term goal is to establish ORGOVYX as a standard-of-care androgen deprivation therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer.\nExecuting on our launch priorities represents the first steps toward achieving this goal. Educating physicians, so they have confidence prescribing ORGOVYX, establishing broad access by enabling seamless treatment starts, and engaging patients to drive awareness are all foundational to our commercialization strategy. We've made significant progress across each of these priorities, which I'll now review in more detail. Due to the large percentage of in-office dispensing and specialty pharmacy distribution, we believe that achieving broad ORGOVYX adoption goes beyond clinical education to encompass office economics and operational considerations, including e-prescribing.\nI'm happy to say we are making significant strides across all three areas. The clinical component is being driven by our sales force who are initially targeting key prescribers and are equipped with materials and technology to perform this function virtually as well as in person. The economic component primarily impacts those practices with in-office dispensing capabilities. The vast majority of these practices now have access to our ORGOVYX contract, which was designed to ensure they are not economically disadvantaged when prescribing ORGOVYX.\nFor those customers without dispensing capabilities, ORGOVYX is available through a specialty pharmacy network. And finally, we need to ensure that prescribing ORGOVYX is seamless. This includes supporting office e-prescribing systems, ensuring that practices and patients take advantage of reimbursement and financial support offered through the ORGOVYX support program, and where necessary that ORGOVYX is appropriately added to the clinical pathways to support prescribing. We are very pleased with our early efforts to reach prescribers.\nWe have had over 10,000 total touchpoints with healthcare providers since launch, a high concentration of our meaningful interactions to date have been with tier one or tier two accounts, including academic centers and large urology and oncology group practices that drive a significant share of ADT scripts. We were able to accomplish this in just 5 weeks and almost exclusively with Myovant's 100-person sales force. We are proud to have hired a highly experienced sales team in urology and oncology, averaging 8 years, and many with locally established relationships. Anecdotally, our representatives are seeing customer engagements reaching over 30 minutes with tremendous enthusiasm for the clinical profile, particularly the compelling efficacy; the cardiovascular profile; and given the ongoing pandemic, ORGOVYX's oral formulation.\nWe are pleased to report that the Pfizer sales team is now fully trained and joined us in the field last week which should bolster the early momentum that we were able to generate. As mentioned previously, the vast majority of in-office dispensing practices has access to our contract pricing, and these early efforts are translating into ORGOVYX orders. In fact, 10 out of our top 20 highest priority accounts have already placed orders and, another encouraging sign, 30% of all accounts that have placed ORGOVYX orders have already reordered. In addition, half of our highest priority accounts have ORGOVYX in their e-prescribing system which is great progress.\nWe have also made notable progress in establishing broad patient access to ORGOVYX. Our distribution channel was fully stocked within 72 hours of launch. And our patient support program, including the free-trial program and co-pay support for commercial patients, went live during the first week of launch. Regarding payer coverage, approximately 30% of commercial patients currently have access to reimbursement today via pre-review coverage, and more may have access through the formulary exceptions process.\nPart D patients may also have access today via their formulary exceptions process. Our patient support services include support for prior authorization, and we have seen a good success rate with these requests so far. Engagement with payers continues with initial commercial coverage decisions expected in the first half of 2021 which should support coverage for most commercial patients beginning in the second half of 2021. The path to broad Medicare Part D coverage starts with submitting our bids for the 2022 plan year, and we expect decisions by the May or June time frame.\nFollowing these decisions, we do expect some Medicare Part D plans to offer access to ORGOVYX in 2021 with broad coverage anticipated no later than January 2022. Our strategy for engaging patients has three phases, two of which have already launched. The goal for our initial campaign is to drive early brand awareness with highly engaged patients, let them know ORGOVYX is approved and available, and drive them to talk to their doctor. In the second half of this year, after prescriber education milestones are met, we will look to broaden our awareness efforts with the goal of increasing patient activation through targeted direct-to-consumer campaign.\nOur efforts to drive patient adherence utilize a three-pronged approach. When a patient initiates ORGOVYX, nurse services are offered to each patient to coach them through the early days on therapy. A welcome kit with information on what a patient should expect after starting ORGOVYX, as well as a treatment planner to help the patient remain on track, is also provided. As treatment continues, patients are sent monthly mailers that provide helpful information on ORGOVYX and other content to maintain engagement and adherence.\nWe are off to a great start regarding patient engagement. In the few weeks since launch, we had over 37,000 total visits to our ORGOVYX patient website, 83% of which were unique visitors with nearly one in five visitors downloading material. This is four times higher than our benchmarking data for other recent oncology product launches and likely reflects just how engaged men with prostate cancer and their caretakers are in making decisions regarding their health. We are very pleased with the early progress we have made on all three of our launch priorities and look forward to keeping you updated in the future.\nI will now turn the call over to Frank to review our fiscal third-quarter financial results. Frank?\nFrank Karbe -- President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Adele, and good morning, everyone. I will focus my comments on the highlights of our financial performance in the quarter and refer you to our press release and Form 10-Q issued earlier today for additional information. Please remember that Myovant's fiscal year starts on April 1, so the financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, represent our third fiscal quarter of 2020. I will begin with revenue.\nWe recorded $1.4 million of collaboration revenue, which represents about one week's amortization of the upfront payment received from Pfizer. Given the signing of the deal occurred in late December, the amortization period in fiscal Q3 was very short. Collaboration revenue related to the upfront payment will increase to $21 million in fiscal Q4 and is expected to remain constant each quarter thereafter over the next six years. R&D expenses in the quarter were $30.5 million compared to $48.9 million for the comparable prior-year period.\nThe decrease in R&D expenses primarily reflects the completion and continued wind down of Myovant's Phase 3 programs, partially offset primarily by increased expenses associated with the build-out of Myovant's medical affairs organization in preparation for the U.S. launch of ORGOVYX and the potential commercial launches of relugolix combination tablet for women's health. Our R&D expenses in the quarter also reflect a cost-sharing reimbursement from Pfizer of $7.6 million for expenses associated with prelaunch commercial inventory. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $49.2 million, compared to $29.1 million for the comparable prior-year period.\nThe increase was primarily due to increased spending on commercial readiness activities to support the U.S. launch of ORGOVYX; personnel-related costs, including the hiring of our oncology sales force; and other general overhead expenses, as we continue to prepare for the potential commercial launches of relugolix combination tablet in the women's health indications. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $79.7 million, of which approximately $7 million was stock-based compensation. We also incurred a $5.8 million gain on foreign currency during the quarter that was recorded in our other income line.\nMyovant generated a net loss of $73.8 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $85.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. On a per-share basis, our net loss was $0.82 in third-quarter 2020 and $0.96 in the prior-year period. Now looking ahead, we expect R&D expenses over the next several quarters to be at roughly similar levels to our fiscal Q3 2020 R&D expense, excluding the $7.6 million of expense reimbursement from Pfizer. Declining spend on clinical programs that are winding down, as well as our sharing of certain expenses with Pfizer, are expected to be offset by incremental spend on relugolix life cycle management activities, such as the planned Phase 3 SERENE study.\nIn upcoming quarters, where regulatory filing expenses are incurred, there could be modest deviations from this trend. SG&A expenses, overall, are expected to continue to increase from fiscal Q3 2020 levels as we continue to build out our commercial capabilities and support our commercialization activities. This increase is primarily driven by the hiring of our women's health sales force, which we now expect will be comprised of approximately 120 sales professionals and is expected to occur in fiscal Q1 2021 as we approach the FDA's uterine fibroid target action date of June 1, 2021. Additionally, our fiscal third quarter 2020 reflected only partial expenses of our prostate cancer sales force because the hiring occurred gradually over the course of the quarter.\nFinally, please note that in fiscal Q4 2020, we expect to record incremental noncash stock-based compensation expense of approximately $28 million due to the accelerated vesting and modification of our former CEO's equity awards upon her separation from the company. Let me wrap up by commenting on our cash position. We ended the quarter with $746 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on our balance sheet. This was bolstered by the $650 million upfront payment that was received from Pfizer in late December 2020.\nAs of the end of fiscal Q3, there was approximately $86 million of capacity remaining under the low-cost loan facility that Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, our majority shareholder, extended to us. An additional $200 million loan commitment that was extended to us by DSP in August 2020 also remains available to us until March 2021. Let me also remind you that there are several potential milestone payments anticipated in the coming months that will further enhance our strong liquidity position. As Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, Myovant could receive additional payments of up to $250 million under the Pfizer collaboration alone within the next 18 months.\nThis could be composed of up to $200 million of regulatory milestones for FDA approvals in women's health, as well as a $50 million payment that would be triggered should Pfizer exercise its option to obtain development and commercialization rights to relugolix in oncology outside the U.S. and Canada. This is a decision we anticipate Pfizer will make during the first half of this year. So overall, Myovant is well capitalized to advance our commercial launches and potentially expand our pipeline.\nNow with that, I'll turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Frank, Adele, and Juan Camilo. In summary, this is an exciting time for Myovant with the ongoing launch of ORGOVYX and the potential upcoming launch of relugolix combination tablet in the uterine fibroids indication around midyear. Our focus is squarely on successfully executing these launches and working with Pfizer to ensure we are efficiently bringing these important therapeutic options to patients in the U.S. And as Frank highlighted, we are approaching commercialization from a position of financial strength, which we expect to continue to build as we achieve additional upcoming milestones.\nThe 1-year SPIRIT results position relugolix combination tablet as a potential best-in-class therapy for women with endometriosis and will support upcoming regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU. I am extremely proud of all of the work done by the Myovant team to get us to this point, and I look forward to what's ahead. Thank you for your attention, and now I'll turn it back over to Ryan to begin the Q&A session.\nRyan Crowe -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you, Dave. Operator, can we now please poll for questions?\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Jason Butler with JPM Securities. Your line is open.\nJason Butler -- JMP Securities -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking the question, and we appreciate all the details you ran through there. I guess just the first one on the commercial side. Can you speak to the types of patients that are being initiated on therapy first, newly diagnosed versus having been through prior therapies, severity of disease, etc.? And then just on the contraception program, can you just speak to -- I guess just review for us the data you have from your Phase 3 trials -- the completed Phase 3 trials and extension studies in terms of pregnancy frequency and just any regulatory dialogue or precedence that you think is relevant here.\nThanks.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Thanks for joining us this morning, Jason. Really appreciate the question. I'll cover the types of patients, and I'll ask Adele to weigh in, and then I'll turn it over to Juan Camilo for the contraception study.\nBut just as a reminder, when we look at the types of patients, I just want to recall -- I know many of you know this regarding our distribution channel. So while we are a retail product, we don't receive the same data that would be typical as an oral agent in the retail setting. Recall, we're in the specialty pharmacy distribution. And therefore, the visibility we have as the product goes into our specialty distributors and then ultimately to in-office dispensing, the visibility we have on patient-level data is limited.\nSo I just put that as a reminder, and I'll turn it over to Adele to add color on what we would expect to see in terms of the patient profile. Adele?\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nYes. Thanks for that, and thanks for the question. What I will say, it is a bit early. We will still continue to gather information on our patients and have a bit more insights into that.\nBut what I can tell you today is that our medical affairs team is actually engaging our providers on how we would go about transitioning patients who are on other therapies as well as initiating. So what that tells us is we are hearing what we would expect to hear is that doctors are interested in starting patients on ORGOVYX who are either new to therapy or who are experienced. So what I can tell you is that's what we're seeing to date.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd then Juan Camilo, would you take the contraception question?\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nYes. Yes. Dave, thank you. So Jason, with the -- we're excited, very excited about the contraception study.\nAnd I heard two questions in your question. One is any regulatory precedent and comment on the pregnancy in prior studies. I'll start with the second one. As we've mentioned in our prior presentations, we have seen a few pregnancies in our prior studies, mostly on the placebo patients, but a couple in patients receiving relugolix combination therapy.\nIn these studies, we were not set up for assessing prevention of pregnancy nor patients were instructed to take this drug as their means for prevention of pregnancy. Every patient in these studies was required to use nonhormonal methods of contraception, so these studies are not really set out for assessing the contraceptive efficacy of relugolix combination therapy. We have shown before our ovulation inhibition study that demonstrated 100% ovulation inhibition, and this is a study specifically designed to assess the effect of relugolix combination on ovulation. So we're very, very confident on that.\nAnd therefore, we decided to take the next step, which is to conduct a study that is a pretty standard design study. This is the way the studies look like when you're assessing contraception. So we have decided to run that study to provide that information to patients and physicians.\nJason Butler -- JMP Securities -- Analyst\nGreat.\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nI hope I answered your question.\nJason Butler -- JMP Securities -- Analyst\nYeah. That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen. Your line is open.\nPhil Nadeau -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGood morning. Congrats on the progress, and thanks for taking my question. First one on the commercialization efforts with Pfizer. Can you discuss how the resources you're getting from Pfizer and their sales force is coordinating with your own plans in the U.S.? Who takes what? And how is that decided?\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I'll kick off. And once again, I'll turn it over to Adele. I think, again, we view Pfizer as really the ideal partner, not only for women's health eventually but right out of the gate here with prostate cancer.\nAnd one of the areas that we really value from Pfizer is the long-standing relationships they have with customers and their knowledge of prostate cancer itself but also the speed in which they've moved to really activate around this launch and that they were fully trained and in the field as early as just last week. So we're really heartened by the speed in which they've been able to be trained and get up to speed on the therapy and then really start to contribute. So I'll turn it over to Adele to add her perspective as well.\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nI would ask you, Dave, to come online in the last week, and what we're hearing and actively monitoring is the very active collaboration at the ground level. So the rest are coordinating in terms of the calls that they're making on the prescribers. And also, we're actively ensuring that they're working collaboratively as it relates to our most important accounts because in addition to the sales representatives that we have from Pfizer, we also will have the opportunity to tap into their key account managers and the teams that they have that are covering these large group practices and those other accounts that are primarily the ones with the in-office dispensing that we talked about.\nPhil Nadeau -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGreat. That's very helpful. On the economics deal, how does it work pre and post profitability? Is there a true-up every quarter on your expense lines on SG&A and R&D? Or will there be a separate reimbursement line where you'll record some of the reimbursements as revenue pre profitability? And then post profitability, will there be a collaboration profit share in your expense lines?\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So there was a little feedback on the beginning of that. But I think, Frank, if you caught that question, I'll turn it over to you to clarify.\nFrank Karbe -- President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think I caught it. Thank you, Phil. Let me maybe speak more broadly about how the Pfizer collaboration will be reflected in our financial statements, and there's maybe four points to make here.\nThe first one is remember that Myovant will record 100% of the net product revenue. So under our revenue section in the P&L, going forward, there will be several captions. One of them will be net product revenue that will show 100% of the net product revenue. There will also be a line that will be titled something along of collaboration revenue, which will be comprised of the amortization payments from the upfront payment and any potential milestone payments.\nAnd then under our cost of goods portion of the P&L, we will have a line item called collaboration expense, and that will reflect the gross profit share with Pfizer, will essentially be comprised of the net product revenue, minus cost of goods, and half of that is attributable to Pfizer. So you'll see that on a separate line item called collaboration expense. And then thirdly, with regards to expense sharing, the allowable expenses that are subject to expense sharing will flow through the respective line items in R&D and in SG&A. And the way this will appear on our P&L is basically as a reduction in our expenses.\nSo R&D and SG&A expenses will appear lower, going forward, than they would have been without the Pfizer collaboration.\nPhil Nadeau -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nThat is very helpful. And then one last question from us. Just on the -- it's a follow-up to the question on the pregnancy study. In terms of the Pearl index, what needs to be achieved in order to support licensure? Is there any regulatory precedence for what you have to show?\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nJuan Camilo?\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nYes. Thank you, Phil. As I mentioned before, this is a pretty traditional design, like any other contraception study. And it's based on regulatory guidance documents from the FDA and how the study should be designed.\nAnd the Pearl index, it's a pretty simple calculation. It's just the number of pregnancies that occur over a 100-patient years of exposure. So we enroll patients that are otherwise believed to be fertile, and they agree to use relugolix combination therapy as their only method for prevention of pregnancy. And then we collect the number of pregnancies and divided by the number of months that women were taking this medication, and that gives you the Pearl index.\nPhil Nadeau -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nRight. But is there a specific hurdle that you have to reach? Like if the Pearl Index is over x, you can't get the label, but if it's below x, it could be approved.\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nYes. We're not going to comment on that at this moment. I think that you just want to demonstrate the ability to prevent pregnancy, and we're pretty confident, based on our ovulation inhibition data, that we will get a Pearl index that is pretty reassuring to physicians and patients.\nPhil Nadeau -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats again on your progress.\nOperator\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Eric Joseph with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nEric Joseph -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Was just wondering if you could elaborate on how long the free-trial period is being offered to patients with ORGOVYX, particularly among government-insured patients.\nI guess will physicians have sort of enough flexibility to write to Medicare patients until there's a formal Part D coverage decision and then I have a follow-up on the contraception study.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Well, Eric, regarding the free trial program, the free trial program is available to all patients. As I'm sure you know, that has an extension of up to two months. And then beyond that, we have a bridge program that's open to commercial patients in which that enables patients to stay on therapy while commercial coverage is being determined.\nSo two months for the free trial and then an extension for commercial patients on bridge. Regarding progress on what we're seeing in terms of Medicare coverage, I'll turn it over to Adele.\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nThe point that Dave made is the right one, is that the free-trial program is offered to both commercial and Medicare patients. And what I can say about the Medicare patients is that they do have access to the formulary exception process, and we're seeing this actually happen. So we have the formulary exceptional process for those Medicare patients -- who were Medicare Part D patients. And I'll comment that we continue to have very good discussions with the Medicare Part D plans.\nAnd I'll remind you that by May, June time frame of this year, we should have our decisions. And we do expect some plans will come on online, even in 2021. Of course, the majority of coverage starts in January of '22, but we will expect to see some plans come online this year.\nEric Joseph -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. And I guess just trying to better understand the strategic rationale behind the contraception study with the combination tablet. Is it correct to read this as a desire to directly compete with OCTs and potentially forego the need to step through oral contraceptive use in the endometriosis segment? And then if that's the case, have thoughts around sort of pricing of the combination tablet change as a means of maximizing the value proposition there?\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Well, regarding pricing, I think we're not in a position to talk yet about pricing, but I'll ask Juan Camilo to talk about the strategic rationale.\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nYes. Thank you, Dave, and thank you, Eric. So let me just clarify one thing. We are not going to compete with combined hormonal contraceptive in the overall population.\nWhat we've heard loud and clear from patients and from their physicians is that we're talking about a premenopausal population for both indications: endometriosis and uterine fibroids. And in addition to wanting treatment for these conditions, they want to manage their lives, and contraception is a component of that. So as I mentioned in my remarks that what's available today in terms of GnRH antagonist treatment does not provide -- well, requires the use of barrier methods of confection that, quite honestly, are not usually desirable by patients nor consistently used. So we believe that -- I haven't seen the data from our ovulation inhibition study.\nWith 100% of ovulation inhibition, we have an opportunity to provide a full prevention of pregnancy, in addition to the treatment of symptoms of uterine fibroids or endometriosis, if approved, for these patients that desire it. And we believe that would be highly differentiating from other drugs in the class.\nEric Joseph -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThank you, guys. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Paul Choi with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nPaul Choi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. First, just on the Part D discussions. I was wondering if you could just clarify and elaborate a little bit.\nFirst, is there a possibility of temporary codes for 2021 versus the exception process? And then also, just to confirm. You're seeking a permanent J-code or something comparable to that for '22.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo Adele, I'll let you address the -- our expectations around Part D coverage.\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nYes. And we can double check this. But in terms of codes, we're not pursuing any of that. We're going with the standard process, so I'm not quite sure that's relevant for us.\nWe have been having very good discussions with the payers, as I've said, both on the commercial and on the Medicare side. And we started this process end of last year, and we're continuing it with coverage decisions midyear and plans coming online thereafter.\nPaul Choi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you for that. Then last, just with regard to Europe, can you maybe tell us where you are with regard to your own commercial infrastructure build? Specifically, I know you're considering and still waiting on the potential Pfizer opt-in but just where you are with respect to your commercial infrastructure development in Europe.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Paul. I think when you look at women's health in Europe, we've already established a collaboration with Gedeon Richter. So we're very enthusiastic as we approach the potential commercial approval in uterine fibroids that we would hope would come around midyear. And so Gedeon Richter will be the lead commercial or will lead the commercial efforts in women's health.\nRegarding prostate cancer, as we've mentioned, Pfizer has the first option or right of first refusal, so to speak, of the prostate cancer. We expect that they will make that decision in the first half of this year. In our negotiations and the collaboration, they were very enthusiastic about that opportunity, so we will await their decision as we get closer. Should they choose not to take that option, we did have and still do have other partners who are very interested in the prostate cancer opportunity in Europe.\nAnd so we will have plenty of time to determine another partner that could potentially launch prostate cancer in Europe. We are not currently building out our European infrastructure to support those launches directly. We will do that through partnerships.\nPaul Choi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK. Great. And then just lastly, in terms of your physician checks and just sort of where the European practitioners broadly see relugolix fitting in, in terms of the ADT landscape for prostate cancer, can you maybe just comment on what your early market research is suggesting where it could potentially fit in?\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Paul. I will ask Adele to comment on your question.\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nYes. Search In Europe, we haven't done an extensive amount, but how physicians prescribe and maybe Juan Camilo could just add, but we see patients with advanced prostate cancer and the incorporation of ADT in a similar manner. And just as we would expect in the U.S., we have our goal of ORGOVYX becoming the new standard of care for ADT. We would hope to see that in Europe.\nBut I'll ask Juan if you -- Juan Camilo if he wants to comment on prescribing because it's pretty parallel.\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nYes. Thank you, Adele. I think you're right. It's pretty parallel to the U.S.\nAgonists are the primary form of ADTs there. With the physicians that we've spoken in Europe, there is a high enthusiasm for the antagonists being now available in a way that is. well, not available, but could potentially be available for an oral route, and they look forward to seeing it. So I don't think it's very different than what we see in the U.S.\nPaul Choi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nThank you very much.\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nThank you, Paul.\nOperator\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citi. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal -- Citi -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Maybe a couple of questions. So one question on the cadence of revenue uptake going forward.\nIt sounds like you're saying that I mean you're creating the awareness. And obviously, there is probably more toward the back half of the year as you get into some of those Medicare plan and maybe more to come in 2022. Am I reading it right? And to that end, I mean, consensus seems to be assuming about $50 million for 2021 calendar year. Does this seem reasonable to you, considering all that?\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I'm not sure I heard the entire question. There was a little breakup there, but let me just speak to -- we're not in a position to provide revenue guidance at this point. We need a few more quarters, I think, to get a sense of the trajectory that we are seeing. What we can say is that we are very pleased that we already have a 30% commercial plans that are providing coverage prior to their formulary decisions, and so we feel very comfortable that that's a great statement in terms of how payers are viewing the therapeutic area and the role ORGOVYX can play.\nWe anticipate that we will have more commercial decisions, not only this quarter but leading into the second quarter. So our ability to monetize the demand trajectory that we're seeing looks very promising. And then as you mentioned, in terms of Part D plans, I think Adele mentioned that we expect that some of those decisions will begin happening we anticipate this year, but much of that coverage will actually take place at the beginning of next year. So that's when we would see more monetization of that patient volume will be more substantial as we get into the beginning of 2022.\nSo I hope that provides clarity on what you're looking for there, Mohit.\nMohit Bansal -- Citi -- Analyst\nWell, this is very, very helpful. And maybe one big-picture question. Now that cash is not an issue for you, plus, I mean, the Pfizer option, you could have more cash coming in. How are you thinking about growing beyond relugolix? And would that be something internal in terms of building your pipeline? I'm quite intrigued by the R&D comment that R&D would probably be stable for a few quarters.\nSo just thinking about the future, four to five years down the line, how you are thinking about using this cash, utilizing this cash to build a company for the future.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Well, I'll make some intro comments, and then I'll turn it over to Frank here. But I think from a big-picture perspective, we have two large corporate priorities this year. The first is execution.\nWe will execute on our launches. We will work diligently to make sure that we get our therapies in the hands of patients. And part of that execution is also our regulatory filings and seeing those through. But you've touched on the second large pillar of our strategy this year, which is really building a sustainable growth for many years to come, and that has to do with really building out our pipeline.\nI think our organization has demonstrated that we are an outstanding clinical development organization, and we want to leverage those strengths to really make sure that we are building our pipeline. So when we talk about the cash, the areas of focus will be, first of all, partnering with Pfizer on building out the relugolix franchise because we see additional opportunities there in women's health and in cancer and oncology. And so that will be one of the key areas of priority, and we've already made significant progress with Pfizer in the discussions around the prioritization there. Second, in terms of building our pipeline, of course, we have MVT-602.\nAnd we are assessing what the different applications of that therapy could be and will come back at a future date with kind of prioritization of how we see any potential development there. And then third is really the business development efforts. As you can imagine, we would stay closer to home in terms of our focus being women's health as well as oncology. Those would be the areas of prioritization in building out our pipeline.\nSo those would be kind of the strategic direction. And I'll turn it over to Frank, if you want to add any further color on how we might allocate that and making sure that as we look at business development, we're really looking toward the right valuations.\nFrank Karbe -- President and Chief Financial Officer\nMaybe just to highlight again the comment I made about sort of the directional guidance where we expect R&D expenses to grow. As you said, Mohit, we expect it to be constant over the next few quarters. Keep in mind, I mean, R&D expense overall has come down quite substantially, about $20 million from the same quarter a year ago. But we expect it now to be about constant because, as Dave said, we have this proven development engine, and we want to keep that engine humming.\nAnd in the first instance, we are not doing this with some life cycle management opportunities. You heard the first example of that with the SERENE study that we plan to initiate, and there are likely others to follow. And then beyond that, of course, we are now evaluating other opportunities to bring in assets that extend the Myovant's pipeline beyond the relugolix franchise.\nMohit Bansal -- Citi -- Analyst\nVery helpful. Thank you very much, Dave and Frank.\nOperator\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Ami Fadia with Leerink. Your line is open.\nAmi Fadia -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Firstly, just on the commercial front.\nMaybe a question for Adele. Can you talk about how your and the Pfizer sales force is sort of coordinating on sort of splitting up the various territories, etc.? And you kind of talked about 10 -- sorry, 20 key accounts. Can you help us understand how much the top 20 accounts that you're focusing on accounts for the total addressable market here? And then secondly, I had a question on just sort of commercial coverage. What is your anticipation with regards to any type of prior authorization that may be required, even on the commercial side or Medicare side, in order to get relugolix?\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nAdele?\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nJust on the commercial coverage with prior authorizations, we are not seeing any issues in that when they're -- when the -- if the plan requires a prior auth, it usually just to ensure the patient is actually according to label. So it's been very administrative to date. It's early days on that, but I just want to signal that we're not seeing any challenges as it relates to the offices who need any support with prior authorizations. We're in there.\nWe're helping with them, and that's going extremely smoothly. As it relates to Pfizer, as I mentioned, there's great coordination. So the way to think about it is that our field representatives, our 100-field reps, as well as their 100-plus reps are working together. They're collaborating on the highest priority positions.\nThese are the physicians that are our top deciles. They're working most closely across those doctors. And as I said, we've had very good, meaningful interactions with the top accounts. These are the high-priority accounts.\nThey could be academic centers or mostly the large urology group practices, oncology practices, multi-specialty disciplines, usually ones that are generating a large share of the prescriptions. Mostly they have in-office dispensing, and those are the accounts that we're really focused on. Some of them are volume, and some of them are about influence, especially those large academic centers. I could rattle off to you, but those are the ones that you would know the big brand new ones that we're really focused on.\nAmi Fadia -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nI guess my question is -- sorry, I'm hearing some feedback here. But the -- is it that highly concentrated in terms of the market that the top 20 are extremely influential or carry a fair amount of prescription volume?\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nThey are a combination of very influential as well as they're the ones that are having a lot of volume flow through them.\nAmi Fadia -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nGot it. OK.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nGreat. Thank you, Ami.Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd that's all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back over to our speakers for closing remarks.\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Olivia. Our journey to commercialization is just beginning, and it's built on a strong foundation from the efforts of last year. In addition, we now have more resources than ever to look toward product development and pipeline expansion. So 2021 is certain to be a very exciting year for Myovant, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver on our purpose of redefining care for patients.\nSo thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 73 minutes\nCall participants:\nRyan Crowe -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nDave Marek -- Chief Executive Officer\nJuan Camilo Arjona -- Chief Medical Officer\nAdele Gulfo -- Interim Chief Commercial Officer\nFrank Karbe -- President and Chief Financial Officer\nJason Butler -- JMP Securities -- Analyst\nPhil Nadeau -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nEric Joseph -- J.P.

My name is Lauren, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to Tim Owens, vice president of investor relations.\nMr. Owens, you may proceed.\nTim Owens -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining Genworth's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call. Our speakers are once again remote this morning so please excuse any sound quality or technical issues that may arise. Our press release and financial supplement were released last night, and this morning, our earnings presentation was posted to our website and will be referenced during our call.\nWe encourage you to review all of these materials. Today, you will hear from our president and chief executive officer, Tom McInerney; followed by Dan Sheehan, our chief financial officer and chief investment officer. Due to applicable security law restrictions, our comments regarding the status of preparations for an IPO of our U.S. mortgage business will be limited to our prepared remarks.\nFollowing our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer period. In addition to our speakers, Rohit Gupta, chief executive officer, Genworth Mortgage Insurance, will be available to take your questions. During the call this morning, we may make various forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from such statements.\nWe advise you to read the cautionary notes regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings release and related presentation as well as the risk factors of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. This morning's discussion also includes non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be meaningful to investors. In our financial supplement, earnings release and investor materials, non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP, where required, in accordance with SEC rules. Also, when we talk about the results of our Australia business, please note that all percentage changes exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nAnd finally, references to statutory results are estimates due to the timing of filing of the statutory statements. And now I'll turn the call over to our president and CEO, Tom McInerney. \nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. I want to start my prepared remarks today by acknowledging the announcement we made a few weeks ago about Kevin Schneider, Genworth's chief operating officer, who will be leaving Genworth after serving in an advisory role through May 31 of this year. Kevin has been an instrumental leader on our Executive Committee and within Genworth's Global Mortgage Insurance businesses, over his 25-year career at Genworth and its predecessor companies.\nAs CEO of the Global Mortgage Insurance Division, Kevin led a Global Mortgage Insurance presence across the U.S., Mexico, Australia, Canada, India and Europe. Kevin provided critical leadership to the disposition of MI Europe, the IPO of Genworth Australia and the sale of our ownership stake in Genworth Canada. As chief operating officer for Genworth, Kevin also provided critical operating leadership to the U.S. Life team, all while helping lead the company through our transaction with Oceanwide.\nThe Genworth board of directors and I are extremely grateful to Kevin for a strong and steady leadership and his outstanding contributions to Genworth over his career. Please join me in wishing Kevin well in his next adventure. Now turning to the fourth quarter. Genworth delivered very strong results as we continue to execute well and make progress against our strategic priorities.\nI am pleased with our ongoing ability to achieve strong operating results in what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Following our strategic update on January 5, we have focused our efforts on executing our revised strategic plan and taking steps to strengthen our businesses. First, as we discussed in January, we remain focused on preparing for a potential partial IPO of U.S. MI, subject to market conditions as well as the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals.\nWhile we are not permitted to discuss details associated with this transaction due to applicable gun-jumping and related securities laws, I can tell you that we began our preparations for the IPO over a year ago as part of our contingency planning. Since we announced the indefinite delay of the Oceanwide transaction on January 4, and our intent to pursue a partial U.S. MI IPO, we have received multiple expressions of interest from third parties and various transactions involving our U.S. MI business, including a sale of 100% of U.S.\nMI. The board and management will consider these various proposals, moving forward, as we continue to prepare for an IPO. Our priority in any transaction would be to maximize long-term shareholder value by unlocking value from U.S. MI and further insulating U.S.\nMI's ratings. We believe that additional insulation, along with significant holding company deleveraging over time, would improve U.S. MI's ratings, which are very important from a competitive standpoint. Second, we ended the year in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.1 billion of cash, enabling us to pay off our February debt maturity of $338 million.\nAnd finally, we recently took actions to realign Genworth's expense structure to our current business activities, given the changing footprint of our businesses. The expense reductions completed in January, which included impacts to people, processes and programs, are expected to reduce annualized expenses by $50 million. We know that this is a challenging time for our employees, and we do not take these actions lightly. As we execute our contingency plan, we have a responsibility to align the U.S.\nLife business structure to its current focus, which is serving our approximately three million existing policyholders by effectively managing the in-force blocks of business. Additionally, we need to ensure that our corporate structure reflects our go-forward business needs. With the sale of Genworth Canada and the potential options for U.S. MI, continued streamlining of corporate support functions will be necessary.\nWe evaluate our cost structure on an ongoing basis as we move forward with our contingency strategy. With respect to our U.S. Life Insurance businesses, I want to be clear that we continue to be committed to improving Long-Term Care Insurance model in the United States, which has experienced significant challenges due to the legacy business and regulatory issues when the products were designed decades ago. Genworth is the leader in Long-Term Care Insurance, with 40 years of experience and expertise that we can leverage to help create a much stronger, more viable industry standard model that meets the demands of an aging population.\nDue to our experience in pioneering these products, developing solutions to reduce losses on the legacy policies and learning from past industry challenges, we believe Genworth can play a key role in strengthening the Long-Term Care Insurance market, an effort which is being spearheaded by the NAIC LTC insurance executive task force. In support of this effort, we continue to execute against our LTC multiyear rate action plan to secure approvals for Long-Term Care Insurance right actions and benefit reductions. Our progress on this initiative has significantly improved the financial stability of our legacy Long-Term Care Insurance business with more work still to be done. As I shared on our January 5 call, we had a very successful fourth quarter for LTC rate action approvals with over $160 million in additional premium increases achieved.\nAs of year-end 2020, we achieved approvals on more than $1 billion of annualized in-force premiums, representing a weighted average premium increase of 34% or $344 million on an annual incremental premiums going forward. On a cumulative net present value basis from 2012 through the end of 2020, we have achieved approximately $14.5 billion of approved LTC premium rate increases. As we've discussed in the past, we have no plans to infuse additional capital into, or extract capital from, our U.S. Life Insurance businesses.\nGoing forward, the U.S. Life Insurance businesses will continue to rely on their consolidated statutory capital of approximately $2.3 billion as of the end of the third quarter, significant claim and ALR reserves, prudent management of in-force blocks and actuarially justified rate actions to satisfy obligations to our policyholders. Before I turn to our fourth-quarter results, I want to provide a brief update on where things stand with Oceanwide. The merger agreement with Oceanwide remains in effect.\nOceanwide has informed us it is continuing to work toward obtaining the financings to close the transaction. But based on our recent conversations, we do not believe the funding issues will be resolved in the near term, if at all. While Genworth remains open to completing the transaction, our primary focus has shifted to our contingency plan in the U.S. MI IPO.\nIf there is no transaction, it is possible that Oceanwide and Genworth could, in the future, agree to pursue a Long-Term Care Insurance focused joint venture in China, given the excellent long-term growth opportunities for elder care in China and the strong relationship we have established with Oceanwide. Genworth is in a much stronger financial position now than it was four years ago when we first announced the merger. We have taken several strategic actions to enhance holding company liquidity, reduce debt, further isolate U.S. MI from the U.S.\nLife companies and significantly reduce the capital risk associated with our legacy LTC insurance blocks. Genworth has also delivered solid operating performance over the last several years led by strong results in U.S. MI, which grew adjusted operating income at a 27% compound annual growth rate from 2014 to 2020, which is among the fastest growth rates in the mortgage insurance industry. In addition, we have significantly improved our balance sheet flexibility over the last few years by refinancing our debt and receiving two consents from bondholders that further isolated our Life and Long-Term Care Insurance companies from U.S.\nMI. I'm proud of these accomplishments, which have put Genworth on a more solid financial footing, as we proceed with our plans to maximize shareholder value over the long term. Now I'd like to briefly cover a few highlights of our fourth-quarter financial and operating performance before turning the call over to Dan to provide more details. In the fourth quarter, Genworth reported net income of $267 million and adjusted operating income of $173 million.\nThe adjusted operating income result was the highest quarterly result in the last six quarters. U.S. MI reported adjusted operating income of $95 million for the quarter and reported a record level of new insurance written for the full year. Australia MI reported an adjusted operating loss of $16 million for the quarter, impacted by higher losses from reserve strengthening compared to the prior quarter and prior year.\nThe U.S. Life companies reported quarterly adjusted operating income of $129 million. This was driven by LTC Insurance adjusted operating income of $129 million, net of reserve strengthening. The strong LTC results reflect the cumulative benefits of $14.5 billion of LTC premium increases since 2012, a $75 million year-over-year increase in net investment income and significantly higher LTC claim terminations and lower claim incidents because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe are prudently managing capital and reserves in light of the continued economic disruption and uncertainty caused by the pandemic. As a result, we increased reserves across Australia MI, U.S. MI and U.S. Life during the quarter.\nI'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and outstanding execution during 2020, which enabled us to deliver a very strong full year companywide adjusted operating income of $317 million despite the substantial challenges imposed by COVID-19. I'll now turn the call over to Dan to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year results in more detail.\nDan Sheehan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter, capital positions of our subsidiaries and holding company liquidity. I'm pleased with the continued progress made in each of these areas during the quarter with improved earnings, progress on our multiyear rate action plan, strong capital ratios in our mortgage insurance businesses and incremental liquidity at the holding company. We reported net income available to Genworth shareholders for the quarter of $267 million and adjusted operating income of $173 million.\nIncluded in net income for the quarter was $160 million in realized investment gains, primarily from the mark-to-market on certain securities and derivatives gains, partially offset by a $30 million loss from discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations primarily related to tax charges. U.S. mortgage and housing market continued to perform well in this period of uncertainty with improving home prices, a very large origination market and continuation of slowing delinquencies from the earlier peak.\nWe're closely monitoring government initiatives, including the recently announced foreclosure moratorium extension and fiscal stimulus plans, along with forbearance options currently available, which we view as positives for delinquency and cure development and ultimate claims. Overall, financial results for U.S. MI in the fourth quarter were driven by strong insurance in force growth and lower levels of new delinquencies, partially offset by reserve strengthening. For the quarter, U.S.\nMI reported adjusted operating income of $95 million at a loss ratio of 35%. Primary new insurance written in U.S. MI was $27 billion in the quarter, up 49% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher refinancing activity and a larger Private Mortgage Insurance market. As most of our peers have not reported, we estimate our market share was generally flat versus the prior quarter.\nWhile we're pleased with our NIW levels and primary insurance in force growth of 14% versus the prior year, the low interest rate environment and high refinance activity has driven low persistency levels in our insurance portfolio with varying impacts to our business. Low persistency has increased single premium cancellations which have remained elevated throughout 2020 and benefited premiums during the quarter by $32 million, which was unchanged from the prior quarter. While we could continue to see elevated levels of single premium cancellations, we do expect this trend to decline going forward with a lower mix of single premium product and eventual uptick in mortgage rates. Lower persistency throughout 2020 has shifted the mix of our risk in force to be weighted more toward the most current book years, as illustrated on Page 5 of the investor presentation.\nThe credit quality of these recent vintages remain strong. In addition, our 2005 through 2008 legacy books now comprise only 5% of our risk in force. While new primary delinquencies during the fourth quarter were still elevated versus pre-COVID levels, they were down 28% sequentially, with approximately 56% of new primary delinquencies being recorded in forbearance plans. We ended the quarter with approximately 44,900 total primary delinquencies or a delinquency rate of 4.86%, both of which decreased sequentially, as cures outpaced new delinquencies in the quarter.\nIn total, approximately 31,800 or 71% of our prior delinquencies are in forbearance. Our servicer reported forbearance trends continue to decline from peak levels in May 2020 and ended the fourth quarter with 5.4% or approximately 50,000 of our active primary policies reported in a forbearance plan, with 37% of those in forbearance still reported as current. During the quarter, we revised our estimated claim rates for previously reported delinquencies. The $37 million pre-tax reserve increase in the quarter, primarily reflects our expectation that prior delinquencies and forbearance plans will have a higher claim rate than our initial best estimate, given the slower emergence of cures relative to our original expectations as well as the ongoing economic impact due to the pandemic.\nWith this adjustment, our current blended claim rate estimate for all COVID delinquencies or delinquencies since April that remain outstanding at year end is approximately 7%. In Australia, the economy continues to recover as evidenced by positive trends in the unemployment rate and home prices. Last quarter, the Australian federal government and Australia's large banks extended the home and business loan deferral program, which allowed eligible borrowers additional assistance beyond the original six-month forbearance period. Approximately 2.4% of total Australia households are utilizing these programs, down from 7% last quarter.\nFor Australia MI, over 8,100 loans or approximately 1% of our insured loans are currently participating in these forbearance programs, down from approximately 31,000 loans reported at September 30, 2020. Under Australia regulatory guidelines, these loans are not reported as delinquent. The ultimate outcome of these loans remains uncertain, considering the current macroeconomic conditions, including the phase out of certain borrower support measures. During the current quarter, our Australia business strengthened its U.S.\nGAAP loss reserves by $88 million pre-tax, the majority of which was a result of a refinement in methodology that recognizes losses earlier on average, primarily through the IBNR reserve. The methodology refinement was prompted by observed changes in incidence patterns or delinquencies and claims resulting in part from the COVID-19 borrower support measures previously mentioned. Including this reserve update, the adjusted operating loss for Australia for the fourth quarter was $16 million compared to adjusted operating income of $7 million in the prior quarter and $12 million in the prior year. The U.S.\nGAAP loss ratio for the quarter was 122%. Strong mortgage origination volumes supported by low interest rates drove $6.7 billion of flow NIW, which was up 18% sequentially and 29% versus the prior year. The business also completed its annual review of its premium earnings pattern in the fourth quarter, which resulted in no changes. Turning to U.S.\nLife, the segment reported adjusted operating income of $129 million in the quarter compared to adjusted operating income of $14 million in the prior quarter and an adjusted operating loss of $115 million in the prior year. Our U.S. Life businesses benefited from variable investment income and continued to experience elevated mortality that we believe is attributable in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Long-Term Care, adjusted operating income was $129 million in the fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the prior quarter and $19 million in the prior year.\nResults continue to reflect the cumulative benefits of our eight-year track record of achieving significant LTC premium increases and benefit reductions. Claim terminations were significantly higher in the fourth quarter versus the prior quarter and year. We do not require death certificates for LTC terminations, but assume the elevated terminations were driven by COVID-19. We believe that the recent increase in claim terminations during the pandemic is temporary and has primarily impacted our most vulnerable claimants.\nIn the fourth quarter, we increased claim reserves by $91 million pre-tax, as noted on Page 13 of the investor materials, reflecting our view that the remaining claim population is less likely to terminate than the pre-pandemic average. New claims submissions remain lower than expected, which continues to drive favorable IBNR development. However, we currently believe that the decrease in incidence is temporary, reflecting delays in policyholders going on claim due to COVID-19 concerns and restrictions and that our incidence experience will ultimately resemble previous trends. As a result, we further strengthened our IBNR reserve by $47 million pre-tax in the quarter after strengthening this reserve by $24 million pre-tax in the prior quarter.\nNet investment income for LTC was up $29 million after tax versus the prior quarter and $40 million versus the prior year from higher limited partnership and variable investment income. Shifting to in-force rate actions for LTC, the overall benefits from in-force rate actions have remained strong throughout 2020. For the year, Genworth received approvals impacting approximately $1 billion of premiums with a weighted average approval rate of 34%. In addition, our premium rate filing increased activity for the year outpaced all prior years as measured by number of filings and impacted premiums.\nAs a reminder, in 2020, we began filing for actuarially justified rate increases on new product series, for which we had not requested rate increases in the past. We remain engaged with state regulators in the importance of actuarially justified rate increases and are encouraged by the continued cooperation from most of our regulators. Page 15 in the investor materials illustrates the cumulative approvals by product series. Turning to life insurance.\nOverall mortality for the quarter was elevated versus the prior quarter and prior year. The fourth quarter included an estimate of approximately $16 million after tax in COVID-19-related claims based on death certificates received to date, bringing the full-year amount to $39 million after tax. Term life insurance products continue to be negatively impacted by shock lapses that are higher than our original locked-in assumptions as the large 20-year level premium term life insurance business written in 2000, enters the post level premium period. Total term insurance DAC amortization, a noncash impact, primarily related to these term life lapses, reduced earnings by $18 million after tax compared to $34 million in the prior quarter.\nAs sales levels declined in the second half of 2000, we expect amortization related to term policies entering the post level period to continue to decrease into 2021. In our term universal life insurance product, as part of our assumption updates, we refined our modeling assumptions for premium persistency as policies enter the post level period and do not expect to see the increased reserve dynamic we experienced in prior quarters. In fixed annuities, adjusted operating earnings of $20 million for the quarter was lower compared to the prior quarter and prior year, driven by lower mortality and lower net spreads in single premium immediate annuities. These products continue to decline since we suspended the sales in 2016 with a total AUM, excluding favorable market impacts of $0.2 billion, down 11% in 2020 to $11.8 billion.\nIn the runoff segment, our adjusted operating income was $13 million for the fourth quarter, down sequentially and versus the prior year. The fourth-quarter assumption updates were partially offset by strong equity market and interest rate improvement during the quarter. Our variable annuity products continued to decline since we suspended sales in 2011 with total AUM excluding favorable market impacts of $0.5 billion, down 11% in 2020 to $5 billion. For our U.S.\nlife insurance companies, we completed our review of key actuarial assumptions in the fourth quarter for each of our product lines. In LTC, we updated all claim reserve assumptions. The impact of that update was not material to our claim reserves. We currently view the pandemic-driven trends observed in the latter half of 2020 as temporary and not indicative of future trends or loss performance.\nOur active life margins in LTC remained flat versus the prior year at $500 million to $1 billion. We reviewed the key assumptions for lapse, morbidity, mortality, expenses and long-term interest rates, among other assumptions. For 2020, the GAAP active life margins included unfavorable updates for benefit utilization and claim termination rates, particularly for in-force policies in our New York-domiciled entity, GLICNY. For GLICNY's policies, we've been monitoring emerging claims trends relative to nationwide experience.\nWith the benefit of additional data and actuarial analysis. For 2020, we were able to fully reflect New York-specific experience in GLICNY's assumptions. We've observed that the severity of New York claim tends to be significantly higher than the nationwide average, driven by lower mortality. New York incidence also tends to be materially higher than the nationwide average.\nThese items drove updates to our in-force rate action plan, which is essential to our strategy of proactively managing and mitigating adverse emerging experience. We now project the need for $22.5 billion in LTC premium increases and benefit reductions on a net present value basis. As Tom mentioned, since 2012, we've achieved $14.5 billion of this amount, leaving a need of approximately $8 billion remaining. The remaining amount has grown from last year, but largely offsets the net unfavorable impacts from the assumption updates.\nApproximately half of the additional rate action assumptions added to this year's multiyear rate action plan could reflect the adoption of New York-specific experience that I discussed previously. Also, a significant portion of the additional rate action assumptions include higher actuarially justified rate increase amounts on our newer product series, Choice II and later. These newer product series have a lower attained age and a longer runway for collecting additional premiums. This allows for smaller, more manageable premium increases for our policyholders, but a higher net present value benefit for the approved premium increase.\nWe also completed our actuarial assumption updates for our life insurance products during the fourth quarter with a net benefit of $10 million after tax. Model refinements in term universal life, that I previously mentioned, and updates for mortality, persistency and interest rates in our universal and term universal life products resulted in a net benefit of $60 million after tax. This was partially offset by a $50 million after-tax charge related to universal life DAC recoverability testing, primarily related to these updates. As we noted last quarter, certain of our universal life insurance products with secondary guarantees, require a separate testing on a statutory basis called AG 38, 8D, which uses a prescribed reinvestment rate from July to June each year.\nThe decline in rates during this period drove the need to increase statutory reserves by approximately $230 million in 2020, which we believe will negatively impact our risk-based capitals for Genworth Life Insurance Company, or GLIC, by approximately 20 points. Rounding out the results. Corporate and others adjusted operating loss is $48 million for the fourth quarter and was in line from the prior quarter and prior year. Turning to capital levels.\nOur U.S. and Australian mortgage insurance businesses maintained strong capital positions at the end of the fourth quarter. In U.S. MI, we finished the quarter with a PMIERs sufficiency ratio of 137% or approximately $1.2 billion above published requirements as of year-end 2020.\nThe improvement in our PMIERs efficiency versus the prior quarter was driven by an insurance-linked note transaction executed in October, which provided $311 million of PMIERs credit at year-end 2020 and elevated lapse from prevailing low interest rates. These impacts were partially offset by strong new business levels and elevated lapses, which accelerate the amortization of our existing reinsurance transactions. In January, we received regulatory approval for XOL reinsurance on our 2021 book of NIW, which will provide up to $210 million of PMIERs credit on a portion of current and expected new insurance written for the 2021 book. Our Australia MI business ended the quarter with an estimated prescribed capital amount or PCA ratio of 165%, which is approximately AUD 200 million above the high end of the management target range of 132% to 144%.\nDuring the quarter, the Australia business successfully renewed its AUD 800 million reinsurance program, which was effective January 1, 2021. Absent any impact from cash flow testing, we would expect capital at Genworth Life Insurance Company, or GLIC, as a percentage of company action level RBC at year-end to be above the prior year, including the AG 38, 8D impact, that I just mentioned. U.S. Life statutory income in the quarter benefited from earnings in LTC from the temporary shift in termination and incidence trends and from in-force rate actions.\nFor holding company cash, we ended the quarter in a very strong cash position with $1.1 billion of cash and liquid assets or approximately $740 million above our targeted cash buffer. I would note this excludes approximately $300 million in cash held at U.S. MI's intermediate holding company, Genworth Mortgage Holdings, Inc., that under current GSE restrictions must be used for interest expenses for the August 20 debt issuance or as capital contributions to the operating company. Approximately $340 million of the Genworth holding company cash balance was used to pay the principal of our February 2021 senior note maturity.\nPage 20 of the investor presentation provides quarterly activity, including intercompany tax payments of $190 million. These intercompany tax payments reflect strong underlying taxable income from our U.S. insurance subsidiaries in the third and fourth quarter of 2020. We expect these payments to continue through 2021, although at a lower amount.\nAs we look forward, to fully address the September '21 maturity and maintain our forward debt service buffer, we continue to prepare for a potential IPO of our U.S. MI business, subject to market conditions, as Tom mentioned. In closing, we've taken numerous steps to improve the liquidity and financial flexibility of our holding company as well as position our businesses to navigate these uncertain times. We're pleased with our financial progress and remain focused on providing value to all key stakeholders.\nWith that, we'll now open the line for questions. As Tim noted earlier, due to applicable securities law restrictions, our comments regarding the status of preparations or other matters related to a potential IPO of our U.S. mortgage business will be limited to our prepared remarks.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Ryan Krueger with KBW.\nRyan Krueger -- KBW -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. As you weigh a potential partial IPO of U.S. MI versus a full sale of the company, can you discuss what some of the key considerations would be in terms of making that decision?\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Ryan, I think the baseline is whichever provides the best long-term shareholder value. And that's based obviously on the price on a full sale versus what we think the execution is on the IPO. One of the -- the core plan is the -- a partial IPO that preserves the ability for a tax-free spin-off of U.S. MI shares to general shareholders in the future.\nSo that's an important criteria that we are considering the partial IPO versus the full sale.\nRyan Krueger -- KBW -- Analyst\nGot it. And then I guess can you help us think about any -- I guess if you did do a full sale, how to think about the tax consequences that might emerge from that, as you separate MI from the rest of the company?\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nRyan, I think the main thing is you lose some tax consolidation. There wouldn't be, I think, a taxable gain. But Dan, do you want to cover the implications of Ryan's question?\nDan Sheehan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer\nSure. In the case of the full sale, there wouldn't be meaningful tax considerations for us. We've got a fairly high basis in U.S. MI.\nThe real issue is going to be making sure that going forward, we're comfortable with what to do with the proceeds of the sale and the tax position that we'd be in sort of post sale. But the tax -- a full sale of U.S. MI is relatively straightforward from tax perspective.\nRyan Krueger -- KBW -- Analyst\nAll right. And then just last one. I guess what level of confidence do you have that if you do sell U.S. MI, that 100% of the proceeds will be available to the holding company versus regulators through the Form A process requiring some amount to be contributed to GLIC?\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo Ryan, I mean this has come up a lot, and it's a difficult question to answer. There is no law, statutory law authority that gives regulators -- so our principal regulators are Delaware for GLIC, New York, obviously, for the New York subsidiary, and Virginia for GLAIC, there's no legal authority that gives regulators the legal right to require Genworth or any holding company to contribute capital or the proceeds, in this case, Ryan, to your question from the U.S. MI sale. However, I'm sure there would be challenges from the states, potential litigation.\nSo one of the things that Dan and I and the board have to think about is the ability to ultimately convert whatever proceeds. And the proceeds could be cash, the proceeds could be cash and shares. There's, again, many different alternatives. But clearly, when the cash would be available to shareholders, is a key criteria.\nAnd our financial and outside legal advisors are really focused on that.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Joshua Esterov with CreditSights.\nJoshua Esterov -- CreditSights -- Analyst\nI appreciate you taking my question. I think at this point, you've set yourself up pretty well with a clear runway toward addressing the 2021 debt obligations, assuming a successful IPO of U.S. Mortgage Insurance. But I'm curious to hear about your strategy for dealing with some of the obligations, let's say, over 2022 through 2024 with that time frame.\nYou've got the AXA litigation settlement payment, a couple of debt maturities to plan for. And I don't think existing liquidity plus a partial IPO would be sufficient. So any thoughts on how you plan to approach that would be helpful.\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, certainly, I think we're in good shape on the 2021. In terms of the AXA amounts, they're not due until 2022 and there are significant other sources of cash. We do have potential cash flow next year from GMA and from U.S. MI in terms of dividends or other options with either of those.\nSo I think we're feeling reasonably good about our ability to handle all of the obligations through the end of '24. And then the remaining debt was about $900 million, $300 million is due in 2034. And then the balance, about $600 million due in 2066. So we feel we're in pretty good shape.\nDan, I wanted to provide just a little bit of color on some of the things we're looking at.\nDan Sheehan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer\nYes. Thank you, Tom. So for 2021, we ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash, which is sufficient to pay off both the February, which was paid off this week as well as the September. And the IPO is going to help us rebuild the buffer, but also give us the proceeds to pay off the AXA liabilities in 2022.\nAnd what I would say is between dividend cash flows from U.S. MI, and we always have Australia, which we set as a financial asset for some time. And with liquid asset in U.S. MI with public shares, to the extent that we needed to, we could use any potential sell down to take care of liabilities in '23, '24.\nMy guess -- and assuming COVID lessens in the second half of the year and we return to more of a normal economy, the cash flows of U.S. MI, which has been a very strong business for a number of years, would allow us to pay off the '23's and '24's between dividends and cash on hand.\nJoshua Esterov -- CreditSights -- Analyst\nI appreciate that color. Thanks. If I could squeeze in a second one here. And I recognize your ability to speak to U.S.\nMI is limited right now. But in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that the ratings for U.S. MI were very important from a competitive standpoint. I was curious if you could elaborate on that just a bit.\nIt seems like to date, the ratings disadvantage hasn't been a major factor in Genworth's ability to win business. Is that more about concern about like risk transfer pricing or that it could translate to less competitive pricing from Genworth? Any thoughts on that, where your heads are at, would be helpful.\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nJosh, that's a good question. I would say -- and I'll ask Rohit Gupta, and Rohit is president and CEO of U.S. MI. He's been in that role as long as I've been here for eight years.\nHe's done an outstanding job running U.S. MI. And so he's now going to be a speaker going forward. So I'll let him give you a little bit of a sense on this, the competitive landscape, U.S.\nMI versus competitors. But we think we've been very successful, Rohit and team, very successful in maintaining reasonable market share. When you have six MI competitors, you'd say the average market share should be around 16%. And I think we've been able to be in that range.\nHowever, there's no question that our ratings are lower than the other MIs. And while it hasn't impacted us so far, we think over the long run, our goal is to get our ratings in line with our competitors because we feel then we'd be able to compete on a better basis. But Rohit, you're in the market every day, dealing with this. So if you want to give some comments to Joshua, I think we appreciate it.\nRohit Gupta -- President and CEO for Genworth's U.S. Mortgage Insurance Business\nSure, Tom. Thank you. Good morning, Joshua. So I would just add to a few things to Tom's comments, and I completely agree with Tom's statement that we have been able to navigate very successfully in the market, given our ratings disadvantage over the last few years.\nI think from a flow mortgage insurance market perspective, there are some customers, there are some segments of the market, primarily depository institutions, so think about large banks, think about small banks, that do care about ratings even with our very strong PMIERs levels. And an improvement in our ratings would actually help us compete better in those segments. And those are the segments where, historically, we have not been very successful. So that would be an upside to our flow mortgage insurance market.\nAnd to your comment, in the credit risk transfer market, ratings is an important consideration for participation in those reinsurance transactions. So while we have navigated in that market a little bit, we have not been a big participant in the GSE CRT transaction as well as portfolio loans for banks. So that would be an upside to the business. And lastly, a strategic consideration for us always is, making sure that our ratings also position us as a strong counterparty to the GSE.\nSo making sure that our ratings are competitive, and we are seeing not only from a PMIERs perspective, but also from a ratings perspective as kind of strong counterparty and competitive counterparty in the market are the reasons to shoot for higher ratings.\nJoshua Esterov -- CreditSights -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you everyone for your time.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] We'll take our next question from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.\nRyan Gilbert -- BTIG -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning. First question, Tom, just for you, regarding the potential Oceanwide transaction. Is there anything you've learned since the January 5 call that -- I guess, just anything incremental on Oceanwide's ability to source funding to complete the transaction? Because I think the market is reacting to your commentary around Oceanwide maybe not being able to source the funding at all.\nSo just any incremental information you've learned since January that might have changed your view around the transaction.\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, look, the Oceanwide merger agreement is still in effect. I said in my comments, I believe Oceanwide continues to work on the financing, particularly the financing outside of China with Hony Capital. I think there are ongoing challenges in the geopolitical landscape that are out of Oceanwide and Genworth's control in terms of the relationship between China and the U.S. I think they still want to do the transaction.\nWe still think that transaction, as we've said for some time, we think is the best option for shareholders if it could be achieved. But just given where we are, and time has passed since the end of the year, I have regular conversations all the time with Oceanwide. So we're still working with them to help in any way we can on the financing. But I think we are where we are.\nAnd based on the conversations that I've had with the Chairman and with his senior team, it does appear that it would be difficult for them to raise the financing in the near term, if at all. But we're still open to that. And I think they still are very focused on trying to get the financing in place. So those are the comments I'd make, Ryan.\nRyan Gilbert -- BTIG -- Analyst\nOK. And anything you can comment on just regarding the potential Long-Term Care joint venture with Oceanwide in China, and maybe how you would capitalize your portion of that potential joint venture?\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThat's a great question. And I would say, and I think we've been consistent over the four years, that a key driver for why Oceanwide was and is willing to pay 543 is because of the huge potential in China. There are 250 million Chinese today, 60 and older. That will double to 500 million by 2050.\nAnd I think the government is encouraging outside parties, including Genworth, to come in and innovate in the market. There really isn't a strong, well-developed competitive Long-Term Care Insurance market in China or a health insurance market in China. And so we have been working with Oceanwide beyond the transaction on the strategy in China. And we have outside firms, consulting firms and others advising on that.\nSo I think the opportunities in China LTC are very substantial. There isn't a lot of -- no one in China that I know of has 40 years of experience in the market. So I do think that in a joint venture, we would bring less capital. We'd bring some perhaps, but less capital and -- but our expertise and experience.\nSo my guess is we would end up probably not being a majority owner of that joint venture because we would not put as much capital in as others. There's a lot of interested parties, other partners beyond China Oceanwide that would be interested in working with Oceanwide and the Genworth. So I think it's a significant opportunity. And I would say, while we -- we'll see if Oceanwide can complete their financing.\nAnd if they can, we'd move forward with the transaction. But if not, I think there's a reasonable chance, given the relationship we've developed over the last four years, the work we've done on analyzing the market and the entry into the market, that's a significant opportunity. And if we can't do the full transaction, I think we're very open to that as is Oceanwide.\nRyan Gilbert -- BTIG -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. Thank you. Last one for me.\nThe $50 million annualized cost savings. Do you have an idea or can you tell us the split between holding company expense reductions and subsidiary expense reductions?\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThere was a split. I'll ask Dan to give you a little bit more detail on that. Dan?\nDan Sheehan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer\nSorry. I could not hear the question. Could you repeat?\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThe question, Dan, was $50 million of expense reductions in January. What was subsidiary operating company's expense reductions versus the corporate overhead? think that was the question.\nDan Sheehan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer\nI don't have a breakout. What I would say is that there was a significant amount of reduction inside the Life companies, as a result of some of the changes to realign with our expectation going forward for limited sales. And there was a sort of, I would say, a widespread reduction across corporate generally. Those numbers will be numbers that we'll put forth in the first quarter.\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And the last thing I would say is we did, I think we have specific reductions that we did in January that resulted in our estimate of cost savings of $50 million. But we'll continue to look at that. As I said in my remarks, we're going to need to continue to rightsize the organization as we go forward.\nObviously, it will depend on which option we would do for U.S. MI. But our goal would be to continue to align our expense base, including overhead with the revenues that the business has generated.\nRyan Gilbert -- BTIG -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Geoffrey Dunn with Dowling & Partners.\nGeoffrey Dunn -- Dowling & Partners -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning. A couple of MI questions for you. I appreciate you sharing the singles impact on the premium.\nCould you further elaborate and share the quarter costs for your XOLs as well as the quarter costs for ILNs?\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI'll let Rohit answer those. Good questions, Geoff -- Geoffrey.\nRohit Gupta -- President and CEO for Genworth's U.S. Mortgage Insurance Business\nSure, Tom. Thanks, Geoff. So I think from a reinsurance perspective, we have not outlined the cost in our disclosures, but I would generally articulate the cost being back at pre-COVID levels. And that is for the 2021 excess of loss reinsurance that Dan mentioned in his remarks.\nAnd then from an Ireland perspective, I would say the same thing that the October island that we basically executed after quarter close third quarter, the cost on that island was same as pre-COVID levels. And as we look at the month of February and the transactions we have seen in the market, we continue to see the Ireland market very robust and the cost being very competitive and attractive for us.\nGeoffrey Dunn -- Dowling & Partners -- Analyst\nOK. And then with respect to your comment on the reserve strengthening, I understand that the average is now up to 7%. Are you saying also that you're 7% in the fourth quarter? Or was it a higher number than 7% that brought up the average as well as the strengthening charge?\nRohit Gupta -- President and CEO for Genworth's U.S. Mortgage Insurance Business\nYes. So Geoff, what I would say is we are in an unprecedented environment here when we just think about our overall roll rates and our reserve factors. The forbearance programs we have today are very different than the forbearance programs, we used to have pre-COVID. You are familiar with the numbers, less than 5% of our delinquent base used to be in forbearance programs.\nAnd as Dan mentioned, right now, 71% of our delinquency at the end of the year are in forbearance programs. Essentially, what we did was, as we were navigating through the year, and we looked at cure rates coming from forbearance delinquencies. We did not see those cure rates navigating to the level that we would have expected based on the choice of roll rates we made earlier in the year. So based on that experience, we decided to increase primarily our forbearance roll rates, and the cumulative number came to 7% for all COVID delinquencies, forbearance and nonforbearance combined at the end of fourth quarter.\nGeoffrey Dunn -- Dowling & Partners -- Analyst\nRight. I'm asking, I guess, specifically, what was the assumption for Q4, though? What's kind of your run rate exiting the year? Are you at a 7% assumption, as we go into the beginning of the year? Or is it a higher number that helped bring up the overall average for the last nine months?\nRohit Gupta -- President and CEO for Genworth's U.S. Mortgage Insurance Business\nYes. So we are at 7%, as we end the fourth quarter for COVID delinquencies. And for non-COVID delinquencies, that number would be higher because non-COVID delinquencies were non forbearance. And 7% for news as well.\nGeoffrey Dunn -- Dowling & Partners -- Analyst\nSo your blended number is about 7%?\nRohit Gupta -- President and CEO for Genworth's U.S. Mortgage Insurance Business\nYes.\nGeoffrey Dunn -- Dowling & Partners -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question from Howard Amster with Horizon Group.\nHoward Amster -- Horizon Group -- Analyst\nTom, I think my question was answered, was about the cost savings, where the $50 million was -- would come from. So thank you very much.\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Thanks, Howard.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. McInerney for closing comments.\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Lauren, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. In closing, I would just reiterate that we've made significant progress toward meeting our debt obligations in 2021, including working toward the potential IPO of the U.S. MI business. We streamlined our cost structure, and we also paid the February debt obligation.\nWe look forward to continuing to execute against our plans to further strengthen our financial position and maximize long-term shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees, once again, for their outstanding work in a very difficult year 2020. As we move forward through the pandemic, we'll continue to be prepared for a variety of economic and performance scenarios in our business. And we look forward to updating you on our progress, and thank you all very much for your interest and support of Genworth.\nAnd with that, Lauren, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 57 minutes\nCall participants:\nTim Owens -- Vice President, Investor Relations\nTom McInerney -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nDan Sheehan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer\nRyan Krueger -- KBW -- Analyst\nJoshua Esterov -- CreditSights -- Analyst\nRohit Gupta -- President and CEO for Genworth's U.S. Mortgage Insurance Business\nRyan Gilbert -- BTIG -- Analyst\nGeoffrey Dunn -- Dowling & Partners -- Analyst\nHoward Amster -- Horizon Group -- Analyst\nMore GNW analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts"}
{"date":"Apr 27, 2022, 4:30 a.m. ET","exchange":"NYSE: WPP","q":"2022-Q1","ticker":"WPP","transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nMark Read\nWelcome, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter update. I'm here in Sea Containers House with John Rogers, our CFO; and Peregrine Riviere, who heads up our investor relations activities. So turning to the presentation and before we begin, I'd like to ask you to take note of the cautionary statement on Slide 2. And turning to Page 3, our agenda for today really, I'll briefly go through the highlights of another strong quarter.\nJohn will take you through our financial performance and guidance, and we'll come back just quickly to summarize and then take your questions. So on Page 4, I said, we did have a strong start to the year, continuing our momentum from last year with 9.5% growth in Q1, actually 9.2% on a three-year stack in the first quarter, which, if you look at it, at a compound rate to pretty much exactly 3%, at the top end of our medium-term guidance, and it shows what we've done during a period of COVID and some uncertainty. And I think further proof of the continued strong demand for our services across digital media, data commerce, and marketing technology underpins our medium-term guidance. We had good growth in all of our business lines despite the strength over the prior period, including 8.6% in our global integrated agencies.\nWe saw a 12.8% growth in GroupM in a strong medium market. Importantly, we saw all of our integrated agencies to grow year on year. And together, they grew around 5.6%. And we discussed before, the transformation of our offer within these agencies is key to underpinning our long-term growth and the progress here continues to be very encouraging, and that's a key strategic goal for us as a company.\nOur public relations activity is up 14.1%, and that reflects the ongoing importance of issues management around reputation, purpose, sustainability, and employees. And we're now home to three of the world's leading public relations strategic communications firms with BCW, Hill+Knowlton and now Finsbury Glover Hering, Sard Verbinnen merger bedding down very well. And specialist agencies grew 13% with strong client demand in brand transformation. On a geographic basis, we had good growth broad-based across the board, and John will dig into that at a country level in a minute.\nOur new business track record was good, both in retaining, expanding, and winning new clients include the likes of Mars, JDE Peet's, Sky. And we're definitely seeing a trend interesting within our media business to the integration of digital-analog media in these reviews very much plays into our strengths. A little bit behind the reorganization of GroupM we had earlier this week. I think it's adults with a view that France splitting out digital media or taking it in-house.\nIn our core part onboarding is proceeding well, and we'll continue to support our growth over the year as it onboards and we have a strong balance sheet, as you'll see. We've taken an opportunity to around GBP 360 million share buybacks, which is consistent with our GBP 800 million target for the year overall. So that talks about the continued growth momentum. What I'm particularly pleased about is the investment in our client offer.\nWe simplified GroupM with the merger of MediaCom and Essence, delivering a more integrated solution to our clients. We announced the launch of Everymile, our dedicated D2C commerce business and the Metaverse Foundry brings together 700 experts from GroupM. And I think that demonstrates a continued and sustained organic investment in the business alongside what we can do from acquisitions. We created the GroupM Premium Marketplace in partnership with Magnite and PubMatic to bring more transparency and control to premium digital media.\nI think again, another benefit to our clients. We continue to invest in Xaxis and Finecast where we're investing in technology, innovation, and product development and bringing those businesses together, so we have scale where scale is needed and they can support our agency brands within GroupM. And finally, we made one acquisition in the course of the purchase of Village marketing, a New York-based influencer and marketing specialists to around 150 people. It's going to give us strong strength in social media.\nSo in summary, I'd say a very good quarter. We've done a lot despite the challenges that I'll touch on in a minute, and that enables us overall to update our growth guidance for the year to 5.5% to 6.5%. On Page 4, really just to update you on the events in Ukraine and Russia. I have to say our main priority has been to support and look after our 200 people from Ukraine in the face of this horrific attack on their country.\nWe're working with the local leadership to provide financial and well-being support, job opportunities to our Ukrainian employees who continue to express their desire to work and live in a normal way. I was in Poland about four weeks ago, and I saw this firsthand, talked to our people there from Ukraine. I've been extremely impressed by the offers of support from our people in other countries, picking up people up at the border, providing them with accommodation and essential goods and services, and really coming together as one WPP family to look after them. We've been partnering with the UNHCR to run an emergency fundraising appeal.\nMore than 4,000 of our people across WPP donated to that raising over $1.3 million, including our match-funding with the broader appeal raised around $150 million to date, a really fantastic effort from our agencies, particularly Blue State Digital who supported that. Now turning to Russia. We announced on the 4th of March, our decision to exit the Russian market. And I'm pleased to say that we've now really reached agreement to divest our businesses there.\nWe'll be selling the business back to the management, and that process is substantially complete. We have a complex portfolio of companies in Russia that naturally takes some time, but we have made that decision. I mean, I think our 1,400 colleagues in Russia have been dedicated value members of WPP for some time, and we obviously regret the decision, but the board decided that operating in Russia is not consistent with our values as a company, and I'm pleased that we've been able to move relatively quickly on that. So that's really sort of a summary of where we are for the quarter.\nAnd John, take us through the financial results in more detail. \nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Mark. So on to the financials for the first quarter of 2022. You may notice we somewhat streamlined the deck so that we can focus more time on the Q&A. Rest assured, all the usual detail, of course, is in the appendices.\nSo coming first to Slide 7, revenue less pass-through costs. At the reported level, we've seen an increase of 10.3% for the quarter, a small tailwind in relation to FX and obviously a contribution from acquisitions of 0.5% leads to an overall like-for-like growth for the first quarter of 9.5%, and that's on the back of 3.1% this time last year. Moving now on to Slide 8 and business sector performance. Again, we've seen very strong growth across all of our business sectors, starting off with our integrated agencies at 8.6%, which is on the back of a 2.8% growth this time last year.\nGroupM, in particular, showing strong growth of 12.8%, again on the back of 5.8% growth for the same quarter last year. Taken integrated agencies excluding GroupM, growth of 5.6%. And as Mark said at the very beginning, all of our creative agencies growing in the quarter. PR really strong 14.1% in the quarter, ahead of on the 2% this time last year.\nAnd again, our specialist agencies also growing 13% in the quarter on the back of 7.5% this time last year. So really good growth, solid growth across all our different business sectors. And really calling out perhaps PR with BCW, Hill+Knowlton and FGH all growing double digits over the quarter. So turning now to Slide 9 on to our major markets, which also I'm pleased to say, are growing well across the board.\nSo strong growth in the U.S. and the U.K. market around 8.9% and 8.1%, respectively. Germany has been one of our most successful European markets growing at 16.1%.\nAnd again, China continuing to grow on the back of a very strong quarter this time last year, 11.9%. India is a real success story at 25.1%. Australia, a little bit more challenging, but certainly showing signs of recovery, as a result of the recent change and the buying in of that business into the WPP Ford. Canada is growing healthily.\nFrance may be a little bit disappointing, reflecting a slow recovery from COVID and some client losses in that region. Brazil, again, huge growth 28.5%; and Spain at 8.2%. So good growth across our key markets. Actually, what's interesting, and I pulled out also the three-year growth numbers.\nSo this is the growth versus 2019, i.e., our pre-COVID year to look at how we've grown these markets over the last three years. And when you look at that across the U.S.A. and the U.K., both growing at 7.6% over those three years which is, again, as Mark alluded to, the 9.2% average over the last three years, effectively equating to an annual growth of 3%, which we think reflects strong performance in line with our medium-term guidance. Germany over the three years, growing at 13.9%, China at 17.2%, India at 32.1%.\nSo again, a real success story there with India. Australia still behind 2019 levels, so down 9.1%, I think reflecting the opportunity to really recover that business. Canada were up 21.1%. France down a little bit again and reflecting a very slow recovery from COVID.\nBrazil at 37.6% and Spain roughly flat. So I think looking at those three-year growth, you can really see where the growth engines are in terms of our geographic focus. Coming on now to Slide 10 and looking at our main movements in our net debt through the quarter. Net debt at the 31st of March 2022 at GBP 2.6 billion.\nAverage net debt over the quarter of GBP 1.6 billion. We saw the normal seasonal outflow of working capital since year end. Our trade net working capital actually improved quarter year on year by GBP 180 million. Again, which gives us comfort, I think, on our flat trade net working capital guidance for the full year.\nAs Mark said, we made -- we actually made GBP 405 million of total share purchase in Q1, GBP 362 million of which was the share buyback, GBP 43 million related to the employee benefit trust. But again, in consistent in line with the guidance of GBP 800 million that we gave at the prelims. So coming on now to our guidance. And as Mark has already mentioned, we're updating our guidance on our like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs to an increase of 5.5% to 6.5% for the year, previously it was around 5%.\nWe've effectively actualized the first quarter and an effect kept whole Q2 to Q4. Headline operating margin, we reiterate the guidance of 50 bps, around 50 bps increase for the year. Again, I alluded to it at the prelims that we're expecting the first half to be slightly negative, probably about 50 bps or so negative, and the second half to be positive year on year about 120 bps, when you aggregate the two together, we're expecting to see a 50 bps overall increase for the year. We're not actually changing that guidance.\nYou might ask why not in the context of upgrade on the top line, but we're effectively seeing the upgrade on the top line drop through as we would normally expect, albeit slightly offset by a slightly higher assumption on salary inflation and that the two offset, hence, why we're keeping the guidance of 50 bps for the full year. Capex in the GBP 350 million to GBP 400 million. Trade working capital, as I said earlier, expected to be flat. Foreign exchange benefit for the year on a reported basis is about 2% to 2.5%.\nWe saw 0.3% in the first quarter, so more will come through in subsequent quarters. M&A of between 0.5% and 1%. We saw 0.5% in the first quarter, and we expect that to build through the year, and I have already touched upon the GBP 800 million share buybacks in 2022, of which we've done GBP 362 million already in Q1. We would expect to do about GBP 600 million by the end of half 1 in line with current run rate in purchasing over the last six months or so, but again, consistent with the GBP 800 million overall that we guided to.\nSo that's the full guidance. I'll now hand back to Mark just for the outlook, and then we'll go into Q&A.\nMark Read\nBrilliant. Thanks very much, John. So we had a strong start to the year, and we have pretty broad-based growth across the business. I think what's important is we continue to invest in the company to expand our offer and drive long-term growth through acquisitions, partnerships, and perhaps, most importantly, continued investment innovation in Choreograph, in Finecast, and Everymile.\nI'd say that the drive demand from our clients remain strong, but we are very mindful of the broader economic environment. As we said, we're updating our guidance after the first quarter performance. That's just how we see the year. And operator, we're happy to take questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nOur first question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Dan, Please go ahead.\nMark Read\nHi, Dan.\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thanks for the question.\nFirst, maybe could we -- I did jump upon a little bit late, but I was hoping, I'm sure you touched on it a little bit where the changes announced at GroupM yesterday. I would love to just hear a little bit more about the reasons for those changes. And in particular, the consolidation of Essence and MediaCom and the creation of Nexus. What you're aiming to achieve out of those moves? And then second, obviously, Mark, your own organic revenue guidance here ticks up.\nWe've heard that from your peers as well. We continue to get questions from investors asking about do agency fees typically lag the ad cycle? Does the ad cycle typically lead the economic cycle? Which I think has been the general pattern in the past. And so maybe taking a step back just from WPP's organic growth guidance. Any color you can add to what you're hearing just broadly from clients as they look out over the ecosystem that is relatively volatile right now? Thanks.\nMark Read\nOK. Look, I think on GroupM, I mean, there were three major changes announced maybe in order of significance, perhaps, the merger of Essence and MediaCom, it brings together Essence probably the -- or certainly the world's largest historically pure digital agency with MediaCom, I think Agency of the Year the last two years. I think the integration of that digital and I wouldn't describe MediaCom as a traditional media agencies. It's very much not by the integration of those businesses talked to continued simplification of WPP, continued demand for scale, and a continued drive for clients in integrated solution.\nI think the same is true of Mindshare and Neo, when -- Neo and Mindshare were sort of working together under one management but it's now more integration. And I think that builds -- Neo was historically an outcome-based media actually started as the digital media arm of OgilvyOne about 25 years ago, if you want to go back into ancient history. And it's sort of the integration of outcome-based media with a broader media offer. So I think both of those always talked about.\nAnd then GroupM Nexus is really bringing together the more technology and operational elements of digital media into one company that can both drive Finecast and Xaxis, but also support the agencies in analytics and technology and operations. So we're looking really for scale where scale matters in data, technology, volume -- media volume but then agencies where they master to provide client service, strategy, and conflict management. Turning to what we're hearing from clients. And I think that it's a very different story from where we were probably exactly two years ago.\nI think clients were looking to cut their spend in the face of what the new will be a very weakened demand. I think clients -- the current time -- are cautious of the experience for the balance of the year. But many have experienced very strong first quarter, Coca-Cola organic growth of 18%; L'Or\u00c3\u00a9al, organic growth of 13.5%. You saw Google's 23% growth who was the top three clients for WPP.\nI think many of our clients is being strong -- continued strong growth as economies open up and consumer spending holds up strongly. I think they are concerned about the inflation pressure on consumer spending, but they're seeing that as more of a sort of second-half impact potentially than a first-half impact, and we'll have to see whether inflation continues to increase or comes off somewhat in the second half of the year. And I think I described at the start wanting to protect their budgets to invest in media. And you are seeing some margin squeeze in many companies.\nSo I think it's a different picture. We are mindful of the economic risk, but our guidance takes into account what we've seen from clients to date and the economic outlook over the year. If John wants to add to that, as we think about the guidance, and I'm sure other people will have more questions.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I'm not sure there's much I can add to that. Obviously, when we set our guidance, we look forward at the range of forecasts that the business could experience over the rest of this year. And I think it's fair to say, if you look forward, if you carry the momentum of Q1 into the rest of the year, we would expect to see some upticks in guidance over time. Equally to Mark's point, if you're a bit more bearish and you thought that inflationary impacts were going to dampen consumer demand in the second half of the year, and that's going to impact marketing spend, then you might bring the guidance down slightly.\nI think we've taken, in my view, a very sensible position, which is reflected in the first quarter's outperformance in our overall guidance for the full year, but effectively held steady assumed growth in Q2 to Q4. I think it's fair to say what we're seeing in the market at the moment. We're not hearing any particular negativity from clients at this point in time. We've got reasonable visibility, of course, into Q2.\nBut there is -- it's undoubtedly, there is huge uncertainty out there, and we have to be mindful of that. I think we made that very clear in the statement today.\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGood. Thank you, both. Very helpful.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Lina Ghayor from BNP Paribas. Lina, Please go ahead.\nLina Ghayor -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Lina here. I hope you can hear me well.\nMark Read\nYeah.\nLina Ghayor -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\nI have three questions, if that's OK. First one, just to come back on your guidance. Could you just explain a bit more what you have factored in, in terms of supply constraint, inflation risks, but also the evolution of the health situation in some of your markets, such as China? And what assumptions have you taken for your guidance? The second question is on Q2. Q2 last year was your strongest quarter.\nSo how should we think about the growth in Q2 versus the rest of the year? And lastly, on the margin, I believe you kept the margin guidance unchanged. So could you explain the reason behind that? Is it just that there's no incremental operating leverage from the additional organic revenue growth? Or there are other factors offsetting it? Thank you very much.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nMaybe I'll have a go at those, and then Mark may want to add. Look, I think in relation to guidance, what we said is very clear that there's a whole bunch of uncertainties out there, supply constraints, market GDP growth, particularly in the European region, inflationary impacts, both in terms of -- on our cost base, but perhaps more importantly, on the consumer and how they respond in marketing spend accordingly. So I think there are huge amounts of factors that reflect that go into our guidance. And that, as I said, leads to a range of potential forecast and outcomes, both on the upside and downside.\nWhat we're assuming in the guidance that we're giving today is a naturalization in effect of the upside we've delivered in Q1, but really holding the balance to achieve for that guidance for the full year is actually a growth per quarter around 4.8%. So -- and I think that's -- in our view, that's a reasonable estimate based on where we see our market going forward. There is certainly upside potential to that, as I said, if we carry the momentum through, there is equally downside potential if inflationary pressures impact on the second half. I would say that we're experiencing at the moment more uncertainty than you would on an average basis, that won't be any surprise to you.\nI think we're being sensible in the way that we set our guidance out. And I don't think I've got much more to add than that. In relation to the second quarter, I think we've got good visibility over growth, and obviously, I'm not going to give specific guidance quarter by quarter. We are expecting -- obviously, this time last year, Q2 was a strong quarter.\nThat said, we are expecting continued momentum coming through from Q1 into Q2. The only caveat I would make to that would be China, where we actually saw quite strong performance in Q1. Given the recent lockdown, we've moved from having office occupancy of around 60% or 70% back down to 5%. That will have an impact in China in the second quarter, I'm sure, but in the most of markets we remain confident and have got good line of sight of growth.\nAnd in relation to the margin guidance being unchanged. Again, the math on this and I'll break it down a little bit. Obviously, we have upgraded our net sales guidance by around 1% or so. That 1%, all else being equal, will drop through.\nI think you can argue that sort of margin drop through 25%, 30%, maybe a little bit higher. So we do definitely get that upside. At the same time, I think we said at the prelims that we expected our salary inflation to be 4% to 5%. So on average, 4.5%, which is what we had baked into our budget for the year.\nI think we're now saying that that will be 5%, an 0.5% increase. So when you offset that 0.5% increase across say 60% of our costs, with the incremental drop-through on the 1% net sales upgrade, the two broadly offset, hence, why we are maintaining our 50 bps of margins for the full year. Again, I'll just take the opportunity, so I want to make this clear that there is definitively a half 1, half 2 split because of the phasing of increases in travel costs and salary increases from last year, as I outlined at the prelims. So we're expecting to see margin in the first half go backwards by roughly 50 bps and we're expecting to see that recover in the second half by roughly 120 bps to net out with the 40 bps to 50 bps for the full year.\nHopefully, that's clear.\nLina Ghayor -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\nVery clear. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Lisa Yang from Goldman Sachs. Lisa, please go ahead.\nLisa Yang -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGood morning, and congratulations on the results. Three questions as well, please. The first one is just to come back to you. I think the first question was asked on this call.\nCould you maybe just remind us of the cyclicality of the various businesses within WPP. And is it fair to assume given the strong demand you're seeing from clients on data, tech, etc., that increasing part of your business is less cyclical, even countercyclical? Any color on that would be helpful. And related to that question, could you maybe just tell us like how much of the remainder revenue -- the remaining revenue for the year are already so secured? Or how much visibility do you have on that? That's the first question. The second is on the new D2C initiative Everymile.\nSo just wondering if you can give us a bit more color in terms of the expected benefit from this new offering over time, maybe initial investments required, is it significant or not. What percentage of your client base do you think could take this, could be interested in taking this? And that also give you the opportunity to tap into for instance SMEs, which I think is an opportunity you talked about for a long time, and I'm just wondering whether that could get you to, to tap into that market? And the third question is on the buyback. I mean you said you probably will be doing GBP 800 million by the end of H1. Do you think there's a needed flexibility to increase that GBP 800 million target that you had given for the year given the strength of your balance sheet and obviously, depending on the evolution of the share price or you're basically strictly you want to stick to that GBP 800 million? Thank you.\nMark Read\nWhy don't I start on the first question and John take over and add to it and then answer the rest? So I think -- we based our guidance on our best judgment for the year. I think our business is a cyclical business, but clients do react differently depending on the economic pressures. I think my sense is we're in a very different point from where we were this time two years ago. As I said before, where clients were looking to cut spend to maintain profitability and margin in the business.\nAnd I'd say now they're looking to whole spend where they can. And even in the case of some companies at the expense of margin to protect the business and drive revenue growth. I think the different media have different levels of cyclicality, depending on the point in the cycle, and probably the media part of our business maybe the most cyclical, but even there, there's a difference between what clients spend on media and our fees. And if clients start to replan media budgets, actually spend more money on fees doing the replanning.\nAnd a lot of what we're doing, if we get to that point is incremental work to think through clients' plans. So I don't think that there's parts of the business, I'd say, a less cyclical or more cyclical, I think we are in a cyclical business, but our guidance based on our best judgment of what will happen during the year. And sort of that's where we are. John, you want to?\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I think that's right. I think there are some areas, if you look back over the last couple of years. You look at the performance, the impact of COVID, and the bounce back, I think you can draw attention to parts of the business that actually remained relatively robust over those three or four years. I mean, I pointed the great performance in PR.\nAnd we actually didn't see PR particularly impacted in COVID, and we've seen that sort of also that bounced back pretty strongly subsequently. So I think PR certainly seen, I would say, it's not particularly cyclical in nature in terms of the spend that we see. And I think there are key parts of our business, I think as you alluded to in your question, on the data side and the technology side, digital, e-commerce, which was cyclical in nature, they are strong structurally, strong foundation, strong structural growth, and I think they do help underpin. So I would say, Mark's right, we are cyclical in nature, but I think we are becoming less cyclical over time.\nMark Read\nSo touch on Everymile then.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So on Everymile. I just think it's a really exciting opportunity. And why do I think that? Because -- for years, we've worked with our clients in building websites and providing CRM solutions, and helping with their marketing plans.\nAnd very frequently, our clients will come to us and say, that's great. But actually, what we're really interested in, can you help fulfill, can you do the whole end-to-end solution for us in these certain markets. So we have got -- and we have had an active demand over the last couple of years from our clients asking us to do this type of work for them. So it's great to be able to announce that we've now built a team of people and some infrastructure that will enable us to provide this end-to-end solution to those clients over time.\nSo I think it's a really interesting opportunity, a very attractive opportunity in my view. We've had to make investments and the overall investment in Everymile for this year will be in the order of $20 million or so. And we expect that investment over time to be around $50 million, so another $30 million over the next couple of years. But we do expect to, over time, create a lot of client interest and a lot of growth going forward.\nSo we think that's a very attractive investment for us. In relation to -- and we think a lot of our client base are very interested in this proposition and obviously, since the announcement we've had a lot of incoming from our clients who are very interested to learn more. That said, I think you also raised the point Lisa about SMEs. And I do think this is, in particular, an offer that is both attractive on a selective basis to large-scale FMCG companies in particular markets, in particular product lines, but is equally attractive to SMEs who do not have the infrastructure to be able to provide that end-to-end solution themselves.\nAnd as you know, we tend to, as an organization, over index on the large corporates and under-index on the SME. So I do think this is actually quite an interesting opportunity as well to start to get into that side of the market in a way that perhaps we haven't been historically. So I see it as a very interesting opportunity. In relation to the buyback, look, as I said, we guided to GBP 800 million for the year.\nI think we will do GBP 600 million by the half. I'm not anticipating at this stage, increasing that for this year. I think we want to keep our options open, keep that balance sheet flexibility. But obviously, we'll update as the year goes, but I would expect it to be about GBP 600 million through the first half and another couple of hundred million in the second half as we guided.\nLisa Yang -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nThank you. And can I just add a very quick follow-up? What was the contribution from new business in Q1? And how do you expect that to ramp-up for the rest of the year?\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nLook, we don't sort of break those figures out in detail. Obviously, as Mark has already alluded to, we have a lot work onboarding Coke and the feedback from the client there has been exceptionally positive. And when we look at our new business to go for the -- the new business we've identified years ago, we're in a better position than we were last year with vis-a-vis our forecast. So I think we're in a comfortable position in terms of new business and bringing on new business into the group.\nLisa Yang -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nOK, great. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Silvia Cuneo from Deutsche Bank. Silvia, please go ahead.\nSilvia Cuneo -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. My first question is a follow-up on the loans of Everymile. Can you please talk a bit more about what are the disadvantages in [Inaudible] the early initiatives discussed for the company's opportunity at the 2020 CMD [Inaudible] And then also, how could we think about the getting new models for this new site? Then my second question is on the progress in integrating the agency structure following the merger of MediaCom and Essence, can you please share your thoughts about how you attract the agenda to drive efficiency gains and margins toward the target range that were previously provided for 2023? And then finally, if you could just comment on the other drivers of the headline operating profit margin improvement beyond the organic improvement, can you say anything about how to think about M&A and FX impact? Thank you.\nMark Read\nDo you want to tackle that? I didn't totally hear the Everymile question, to be honest.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, it was a very -- Silvia it's a very poor line in our side, so apologies. I think I got the gist of what you were asking, so I'll have it go. Look, I mean, in terms of -- I think you asked how it compared to some of the things we talked about at the capital markets day back in 2020. Look, I think in our eyes, it's one of many interesting opportunities we have in the business to invest in our future growth.\nWe've already talked to you many times about the opportunities in areas like Finecast and Xaxis and Choreograph and data. And we see Everymile very much as being adjacent to those in terms of an investment for future growth. We know this is going to be a huge market going forward. So that's absolutely clear.\nThere's massive growth just in the U.K. alone, frankly, in the last year in this area. So this is going to be a huge market going forward. We know that our clients are asking us for solutions in this area.\nThe intention is to provide an end-to-end solution from website design and build through to order management through to inventory management through to warehousing, supply chain logistics and fulfillment, and returns, and so on and so forth. That's not a trivial exercise, and we brought on a very strong team of people who've got great experience in this area that the business is being led by Mark Steel, who -- when I was the CEO at Argos, he was my digital director, a really strong individual, and he's built a very strong team of people around him from some great branded retailers to bring that expertise together. So in terms of potential revenue opportunity, I wouldn't want to be guided at this point as to what we think we can achieve. We'd like to have a number of clients live by the end of this financial year, and we're certainly on track to deliver that.\nAnd we'll see how that revenue builds over time. But there's clearly a massive, massive market out there, and the intention will be to launch as we have done in the U.K. first and then look at selective geographic opportunities probably driven by the U.S. in the May next in order to grow the business.\nHopefully -- hopefully, that addressed your question. I didn't quite catch all of it, as we said at the beginning.\nMark Read\nGo ahead, Silvia.\nSilvia Cuneo -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nThat -- you're answers definitely captured my questions.\nMark Read\nOK, good. On the structural point, I mean we continue to streamline and simplify the business in some respects like Essence, MediaCom, but we continue to launch new brands like Everymile. And I think we say -- we believe there is attractive opportunities in our industry to expand and grow, particularly organically, as well as by acquisition. And our structures designed to capture them.\nIt's much more around a growth focus than it is around taking cost out of the business or driving margin though in some cases, it can help us meet our financial targets. I think the last question was around M&A and FX, John, do you want to tackle that impact on the year?\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I think from an M&A perspective, we said that like-for-like growth between half and -- sorry, obviously growth of 0.5% and 1% as a result of M&A. I think from a margin perspective, we see these things has been broadly neutral. But there's a 0.5 point contribution in the first quarter, we'd expect that to increase slightly through the remainder of the year.\nAnd again, FX, we had a tailwind of about 0.3 in the first quarter, which is largely an offset of the dollar and the euro moving in different directions relative to the pound, but we'd expect that tailwind to increase through the year if ForEx conditions remain the same, a couple of percentage points coming through. But of course, that could change. There's a lot going on -- there's lots of moving parts there. So at the moment, we're expecting to see a bit of a tailwind come through, but we'll obviously update at each quarter as we report.\nI think from a Russian perspective, I think, just to sort of -- I think you asked specifically about that. We think from an overall cost perspective, the exit costs getting out of Russia will be about GBP 40 million to GBP 45 million or so. We think actually, when you look at Russia, we will also be a little bit dilutive on our margin but that will be more than offset by the foreign exchange, which we think in combination will play a draw. And hence, broadly neutral margin overall.\nSo that, hence, why we are comfortable reiterating the margin guidance that we gave at the beginning of this financial year.\nOperator\nOK. Our next question comes from Julien Roch from Barclays. Julien, Please go ahead.\nJulien Roch -- Barclays -- Analyst\nYes. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, John. My first question is on visibility.\nHow much of the rest of the year is already known and guaranteed because I understand that your guidance is best effort, is sensible. It's based on a very detailed budget, very bottom up, but clients can only give you their current budget, not what they think will happen to the budget. So I'd like to know how much net sales you get if everything stops tomorrow. I mean John several times says good visibility on Q2, but I said you were only getting organic for the months of -- a week after the end of the month.\nSo as has that changed. So basically, how many weeks of visibility do you have? How much of the rest of the year revenue is guaranteed and set in store? So that's my first -- my first question. The second one is on margin. You said it was unchanged because better top line was offset by high inflation cost, 50 bps on size.\nSo if net sales disappoint, will margin go down? So I suppose you have some flex so until what level of net sales can you keep the 50-basis-point margin increase. Is it at 3%, at 1%, some color on that would be great. And then the last one, FX impact on next year, 2% to 2.5% this year, but the spot is lower than average. So you should have a benefit next year as well.\nSo I'm helping Peregrine to get consensus in the right place for next year on FX? Thank you.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you. So well, look, the point on margin. Yes, I think the reality is if the net sales disappoint then we can course correct. I think we've got a great track record actually of managing the business.\nAnd we're very agile as an organization. If we see the top line coming through being slightly disappointing, then we can course correct pretty quickly and taking out costs. A lot of our cost, of course, is in freelancers, and we can remove or add that resource relatively easily. So we do track at quite a detailed level, freelance resource, permanent resource across all the different agencies and the networks and look at the forward thinking about the forecast and make sure we've got a cost base that is very adaptable to that change.\nSo now all of that said, of course, if the growth starts to come down to that sort of 3% level, then we would expect to see that to impact the margin over time. So I think that's just the mathematics of the operating model in the business. But I think we could stand -- we could withstand a bit of pressure on that top line through adjusting our cost base. But obviously, if it were come down a lot beyond that sort of 5.5%, 6.5% growth, then that would start drop through operating margin.\nI wouldn't like to say the turning point, but somewhere between 3% and 4% of net sales growth, I would suggest. In terms of visibility, your question on visibility and then your question on guarantee. I mean it's visible, but it's not guaranteed. When we do our forecast for the organization, we get each of the operating units to base their forecast on their understanding of their client budgets.\nI would say that's a pretty good visibility. Now of course, budgets can change. And I think we do put in a great conservatism into our forecast, but nothing is guaranteed and particularly in a world of uncertainty that we live in today. So I'd say we've got good visibility for most of Q2 and Q3 and in some ways, arguably for Q4 as well.\nOur new business requirements, as I said, in our forecasts are lower than they would historically be this time last year -- so that's also encouraging. But despite the visibility, nothing is guaranteed. So -- and there is uncertainty out there. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color as to our thinking.\nAnd I've written down the third question as well. The FX.\nJulien Roch -- Barclays -- Analyst\nYeah. FX, yeah.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nI'm not going to get into speculating about the FX impact for 2023. I'm not sure we can accurately predict what will happen in 2022. So I think we need to -- we're probably getting ahead of ourselves if we're trying to think through the FX impact for '23. What we're saying at the moment, if you're baking the current rates into our forecast, then we expect to see a tailwind of 2% to 2.5% in the -- in Q2, Q3, and Q4.\nBut of course, we've seen quite a lot of movements to FX over the last quarter, and that could certainly change that guidance as we go forward.\nJulien Roch -- Barclays -- Analyst\nThank you. Very clear. Just an add-on visibility. So it's visible but not guaranteed and it's based on your understanding of the client budget.\nSo I suppose the only thing that is really visible is the spend that has been committed already because everything beyond that can be cut. So you would say the real visibility on revenue is what, is it two weeks, two months?\nMark Read\nJulien, this is Mark. I don't think that's the way to think about it. I mean we talk to our clients, they tell us how they see the world. And at the moment, they're saying that they don't think they're going to make major adjustments from what they told us four weeks ago or eight weeks ago.\nWe're coming into the year many of these concerns were known. Certainly, the inflation concern [Inaudible] budgets did bake in, slightly more conservative estimates from the CPG companies and slightly more aggressive estimates from the technology companies. We have, John, said, good underpinning from new business with Coke and Google coming in for the year. And we're making our new business targets as we go through the year.\nThere is clearly uncertainty and nothing is like as guarantee, but our best judgment based on what we hear from clients today and what we're hearing about what they want to do in the future is that we'll meet these numbers. We could if we had wanted to have held our guidance, banked the Q1 outperformance for a softer last week, we've chosen not to do that. I think the reason is that what we hear from our clients gives us confidence that we'll make the numbers in the last nine months of the year. And that's as much visibility or guarantee as anyone have in any of those scenarios, and I'll come back to it.\nIt's a very different pattern of what we heard two years ago where clients were very quick to cut budgets or not. Remind you, Coke saw 18% organic growth in Q1 is a top-five partner for WPP. L'Or\u00c3\u00a9al saw 14%, 13.5% organic growth in Q1 to top 10 clients of WPP. Google despite having disappointed we saw 23% organic growth in Q1.\nSo we have clients whose businesses are performing well. And we have other clients whose businesses maybe a little bit more challenged auto but we knew that coming into the year. So I think it's based on our best judgment on how we see the pluses and minuses. It's true there were pluses and minuses from clients on spending.\nBut as we sit here today the pluses and minuses is more average each other out and we are we are where we are on the guidance.\nJulien Roch -- Barclays -- Analyst\nOK, very clear. Thank you very much for the answers.\nMark Read\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Tom Singlehurst from Citi. Tom, please go ahead.\nTom Singlehurst -- Citi -- Analyst\nHey, good morning.\nMark Read\nHi, Tom.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nHi, Tom.\nTom Singlehurst -- Citi -- Analyst\nI suppose implicit in a lot of the questions you've been asked already, Lisa and Julien, and then actually from the investors, we get the same point, which is there's this sense that it's all going OK now, but you're in that stage where you run off the cliff and the legs are still turning you haven't fallen yet. I just wanted to sort of test whether you think there has been any sort of change that we're just not seeing. So for example, within your client base, are we seeing a fall in promotional activity that's just not being reflected in advertising spend and sort of spend on digital transformation. Is there anything that you can point to that some of these sort of FX are already working through? It's just that you're genuinely not being impacted because as I say, that would give comfort that we're -- we're not just in that sort of state of suspend disbelieve.\nThat was the first question. And I suppose linked to that, the other question I'm interested in is whether, when you see wage pressures, whether that's a factor supporting your revenue growth in the sense that it's these are costs that are passed on to your -- pass on to your clients and therefore, recognize the revenue. So those are the questions on sort of the broad picture. And then one quick narrow one as well.\nAs you mentioned, PR growing really fast. I was just wondering whether there were any one-offs in that? And in particular, whether there's any benefit there from the FGH SVC merger? Thank you.\nMark Read\nMaybe I'll continue with the answer to the previous question. I think what we're seeing in our business is improving structural growth in the company. And a quarterly statement not necessarily point to discuss that. But I think if you come back to our three-year stack of 9.2%, by the way, if you take annualized 3% a year comes to 9.27%.\nSo we're sort of 9.2% exactly at the top range of our medium-term guidance, which underpins the investment case for WPP. I think we see that over the last three years despite the ups and downs of COVID, I think if you come back to what are we trying to do longer-term in terms of improving our own competitive performance in North America, we've seen that with strong growth in Q1 -- on growth in Q1 of last year and improving the competitive performance of our agencies through restructuring. We've seen that with 5.6% growth in our integrated agencies in Q1 on top of growth in the last quarter. So I can only really point to, I think, a stronger structural outlook for the market overall.\nI mean, it's good if you think about what our peers are guiding to that the industry overall is broadly speaking guiding to 5% what are in range of 4%, 5%, 6% growth during the year, right? So I think that's positive. And against that backdrop, we see a stronger structure to the industry. We're seeing a stronger more competitive WPP. And the cyclical things will be the cyclical things.\nI mean a cynic might say, back in October last year when our share price was 12%, you were expecting 3% growth this year as analysts. And now our share price is 10%, your models say we're going to do 5% this year. So things are sort of a bit the wrong way around. So I think that the share price is what the share price will be, we're not in any way commenting on that.\nBut I think that our guidance is based on our best estimates for the year, a stronger and more competitive WPP, an industry that I think generally is expected to be in a stronger structural position, and those are the things that we can manage with and the things that are in our control.\nTom Singlehurst -- Citi -- Analyst\nThat makes sense. And --\nMark Read\nAnd, Tom.\nTom Singlehurst -- Citi -- Analyst\nOh, sorry, carry on.\nMark Read\nGo on, Tom.\nTom Singlehurst -- Citi -- Analyst\nWell, I was going to say, I completely agree with that. I mean, obviously, we're bullish on the shares. But the question is more, is that for example, with promotional spend, are we seeing budgets change somewhere else that's not immediately apparent to us as media analysts and therefore, not sorry, immediately apparent to your revenue --\nMark Read\nIf you look at U.K. media spend, it's interesting. TV is up 17% in Q1, digital video, digital is up 7%. So things are a little bit all over the place.\nAnd I think it depends on the opportunities and where things up. But I don't think we're seeing a pullback in promotional spend. I mean a lot of companies are having to drive promotion -- to drive sales growth. What are the two -- you saw the success of the discounters, I think consumers are clearly being a little bit squeezed in the middle.\nBut the U.K. is only 11% of our business. We've got a big business in the U.S., big business in Latin America, a big business in India. Yes, we do have a big business in China, it's about 5% or 6% of our sales.\nSo I think we're very well-diversified geographically by client sector and by activity. You talked about the strength of our PR businesses, which I don't know if -- there's no one-off effects. I mean I think that, since we got [Inaudible] gives us a stronger business and it's doing well. They're doing extremely well in the M&A league tables this year, advising on several very, very high-profile pieces of business.\nBut I think that reflects the strength of our business and strength of demand for those services. There's not a one-off element within it.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nI mean, Tom, one place I go to look for some of those what you might describe as early warning indicators, either of sort of an uptick or a downtick. If you look at our sort of brand consulting businesses that tend to be quite project-based. And we actually saw that through COVID. I think they were one of the first parts of our business, one of the first sectors of our business to be impacted by COVID because clients cut spend pretty quickly in those areas as they could.\nSo I was sort of look at that area as a sort of a bellwether, if you like, as to the overall business. And we're not seeing any cuts in those areas, far from it, in a way, Landor & Fitch with a very strong first quarter performance and Superunion likewise. So now I'm not going to say that's not going to change. But I think it's fair to say we're not seeing any early signs yet of any changes in client behavior, and that goes across the board.\nMaybe coming on now to your question on inflation, which I think I'd characterize as being -- I think you were suggesting that does -- is wage inflation a good thing because ultimately, you pass it on to your clients in net sales increases. And I think just to echo Mark's earlier comments on the call that if you look back historically, inflation has not necessarily been a bad thing for our sector. And that said, I do think there is somewhat delay in an ability to -- as the increasing costs come in, there's a somewhat delay in your ability to pass those on to your clients, so I think that's all else being equal, a little bit of margin compression that then releases over time. What I would say is we recognize inflationary pressures coming through in 2020 back in Q3 of last year.\nAnd we very specifically spoke to all of our key client relationship managers to look at how we would -- in the right way, remain competitive on price but also have the ability to pass some of these inflationary pressures through. So I think we got ahead of the curve on that. And if I look across the portfolio, I think we've got good balance in being very competitive on price, but being able to pass on some increases where appropriate. And that helps us manage the margin as we travel through the year.\nBut to be absolutely clear, we are seeing more pressure on our cost base coming through, then we're able to pass on immediately in form of increased pricing. So there's a little bit of a lag there, which is resulting in the margin compression that I've described, particularly in the first half, as I alluded to in terms of the half 1, half 2 margin split. But again, completely consistent with what we guided to at the prelims. So no changes there.\nHopefully, that helps. And in relation to your question on PR, I think you said were there any specifics. I mean, in some ways, I think the really good news stories here is -- well, there are specifics in the sense that everyone is trading really well, whether it's BCW, Hill+Knowlton, or to your point, FGH, we're seeing really strong performance across the board. And that's most pleasing of all really a very strong performance across the sector, reflecting the 14.1% growth.\nI think FGH probably the standout candidate, but they were all very strong.\nTom Singlehurst -- Citi -- Analyst\nThat's great. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Richard Kramer from Arete Research. Richard, please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst\nThanks very much. It's Richard Kramer from Arete. Two things that maybe haven't been asked yet. First on we've hosted some investor calls with consultants on media spend and they're highlighting a different aspect of the dreaded high word inflation coming into media costs.\nSo I guess, Mark, question is, are you seeing this? And how do you think it's impacting well as for your clients? Is it going to get harder to deliver that return on ad spend? And then the second question I've got there's just a ton of hype that we're seeing around retail media as the fastest-growing segment of digital, especially given how it directly links to conversion and attribution. Can you talk about the challenges for your CPG clients, for example, finding audiences now that you have dozens of retailers that are probably also your clients that want to be providers of add inventory, which makes it much harder to find where you should be advertising?\nMark Read\nYes. I think on the first question, I mean, there's no doubt that inflation does build into media prices. And particularly in auction-based media impacts it directly into those prices. And that does lead to a deterioration in return on ad spend.\nI mean our reaction is that it has to be to look for untapped opportunities. I mean much of the growth, I'd say, in a platform like TikTok has been a shift from higher to low -- viewing that as an opportunity to drive return on ad spend because it's historically been, let's say, less in demand than other social media platforms. So we help clients respond to that. But that, I think, is sort of the inverter comes beneficial impact of inflation on the media business.\nI think on retail media, I mean, that has, as you say, been a lot of coverage of this. I'd say we see a couple of things, observation space. One is that increasingly, we're seeing clients bring retail media or retail spend together with marketing spend. You see that change at Mondelez and that Unilever where sort of the CMO is taking increasing responsibility for sales.\nAnd I think that that is a positive development. Unilever media review included retail media within our scope, in many cases, for the first time after a thorough review of competitive providers. And I think the clients do need to bring that spend together because what retailers are trying to do is double-dip. They're trying to take spend from the trade media budget, and they're trying to take spend from the brand budgets.\nAnd I think only by bringing those two things together can we protect for the integrity of our clients' budgets to really drive spend where it needs to go. I think that the biggest growth in retail is, as you say on, is in digital media. And clients -- retailers had some success in sort of rebadging what was trade spend as brand spend. But I think it's really just going to cause a shift in spend from what CPG companies would have spent on their trade media into really a different budget rather than in aggregate, drive up what clients are spending on promotions.\nRichard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst\nDoes this widen your addressable market for the spend you tapped into?\nMark Read\nFrom our perspective, that's correct. I mean, it's a positive impact. I think you see it in the growth of Amazon's media business, although Amazon is trying to ramp budgets as well. But I think, broadly speaking, it points to an increase in the addressable market and is positive and another reason why we've been focusing on the commerce sector more broadly.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd I think not just reflects an increase in the addressable market, but also reflects an increase in the market complexity. And we've always said that actually helping our clients navigate the complex market is where we add value. And of course, if that market is getting increasingly complex, we've got an ability to add even more value. So I think we've given a plethora of choices to our clients base that where they place their marketing spend and how we optimize that over? An overall campaign is where we can really bring our experience of operating in these different segments to bear.\nRichard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Matthew Walker from Credit Suisse. Matthew, please go ahead.\nMatthew Walker -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. I hope you can hear me OK. The first question was on Europe and U.K.\nversus U.S. We didn't see a particularly big divergence in Q1. I was just wondering, given that the U.S. economy is supposed to be more robust going forward.\nHave you changed the mix of your budget at all to privilege the U.S. against maybe Europe or your budgets for Europe remain unchanged because you've actually had a good Q1 in Europe, too? And the second question was really around Google and what they said about YouTube. They mentioned a couple of factors there, one of which they talked about brand budgets in Europe coming down or some kind of impact seems to be very much different to what you're saying. So just any reflections on that? And then just a technical one on Russia.\nI'm guessing you're taking Russia out of the organic growth and the GBP 40 million of exit costs there, are you including them in operating profit? Or are you taking them as exceptional costs?\nMark Read\nOK. I'll just tackle the YouTube question and then let John talk about the sort of geographic impact in Russia. Look, I think YouTube -- Google grew 23% in Q1, YouTube, I think 14%, on a comparative, let's say, 43% last year. So it's a very strong comparative.\nI mean I saw Ruth's comments in the FT, I haven't actually read the transcript. And I think part of what she was referring to was -- what's the impact of Russia. Obviously, it impacts them organically, because they are not disposing of an entity is somewhat different from the way we would be accounting for because given that we're going through a disposal. All I'd say is our Q1 numbers reflect our business in Europe, which was up 16% in Germany, which is the largest market, close to that region.\nI don't have the Polish numbers in front of me. But I think we see it somewhat differently. And there's a lot of commentary in the Google numbers. I wouldn't read too much into what they saw in Q1.\nIt was a pretty strong quarter for them, let's be honest, it's a little bit disappointing versus other people's expectations.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd then, Matthew, maybe just to build on Mark's response there. I mean, I think looking forward in terms of the way that we've constructed our budgets and the range of forecasts that we use, both on the upside and the downside to help inform our guidance. I think it's fair to say that on balance, on average, we would have seen a slight softening in our forecasts across Europe and to some extent, the U.K. and a slight strengthening relatively speaking, of our forecast in the U.S.\nI wouldn't want to call it out more than that. To Mark's point, we had a very strong first quarter in both the U.K. and across Europe as we had it also in the U.S. But going forward, we'd see a slight softening decided upon the slight strengthening relatively.\nThe other side of the point, if that helps. On Russia, we're taking that out of like-for-like. And in relation to the GBP 40 million, that will be an exceptional.\nMatthew Walker -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOK. That's all very clear. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur final question comes from Omar Sheikh from Morgan Stanley. Omar, please go ahead.\nOmar Sheikh -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGood morning, everyone. I think just about remember my three questions. So maybe to start with, Mark, it would be very helpful in giving some color by, on the revenue growth by business activity and by geography. But you haven't talked much about verticals, so client verticals.\nSo I wonder you can maybe just give us a bit of color on whether you're seeing any difference in activity from some of your clients, CPG, autos, and so on, which might have been impacted more by commodity price inflation relative to the overall group. Are there any sort of differences in what you're seeing in Q1, Q2? That's the first question. Secondly, we'll go back to visibility point. And I heard what you said earlier on.\nBut maybe if you could just say how often you think client budgets are set, is it sort of monthly? Is it quarterly? Or is it half yearly? So it just sort of give us a sense of when decisions might be made going forward by your client insofar as it's able to generalize? And then finally, I just want to clarify the point in the outlook statement where you said that you remain ready to respond to any changes in the economy. I just want to clarify, do you mean sort of an action on costs, so taking out freelance costs, that kind of stuff, or maybe even sort of agency consolidation? Or is it something else?\nMark Read\nSo look, I think by sector, we've seen strong growth in technology as you would expect in retail, as you expect, given its opening up in healthcare continuing. We've seen weak activity in automotive, which is not surprising again given the chip shortage. So again, it does vary a little bit from automotive company to automotive company. And I'd say in CPG, it's [Inaudible] dozen than the other.\nAnd we have had some CPG companies that I mentioned Coke and L'Or\u00c3\u00a9al they had a very, very good start to the year and strong spend. And obviously, in the case of Coke, the business is onboarding over the course of this year. And the impact it would have in subsequent quarters is bigger than the impact it would have in the -- that it had in the first quarter. We've seen good growth.\nOthers came into the year more cautious. But I think the -- while inflationary pressures have intensified they were -- our CPG clients were very aware of them as they set their budgets for the year. And I think that comes to your second question, which is clients -- I mean, I don't want to make it be unhelpful. Clients can change their mind.\nClients reserve the right to change their mind. But I don't think that they want to go backwards and forwards. I don't think they want to start and stop activity. So I'd say my overwhelming impression to date is that they're looking to protect their budgets.\nThey don't want to make a big leap backwards, parts of our business, a longer-term programs that they don't want to stop and start. And I think many of them have learned the lessons of COVID. And I think it's quite clear that those clients actually that maintain their spend even coming into COVID came out of it in a stronger position. So I don't want to overplay the variability or indeed underplay.\nI come back to our guidance it's based on our best judgment of where we think we'll end up for the year based on conversations with our clients, conversations with our people, and a kind of top-down review based on how we see the global economic outlook and the risks and the balances of positives and negatives.\nJohn Rogers -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd maybe just to -- and apologies if this is overplaying the point. But just to leave you with sort of three -- what we're trying to do in terms of the guidance and the outlook statement, just with 3 points. The first is that we've upgraded our guidance from the prelims to Q1, reflecting what we see as outperformance in Q1 and confidence and momentum in our business with good visibility going forward. And I think that's very clear.\nThat said, there is clearly a range of scenarios out there on the upside and the downside, and there's probably more uncertainty than it would be on average in those forecasts. On the upside, if we keep our momentum in Q1 going through into Q2, Q3, and Q4, we will see upgrades come through during the year. And on the downside, if we see inflation pressures, impact on consumer spending, and subsequently advertising spend, then we'll see some downside. So there is a range of upside and downside.\nWe think that where we've turned out is to Mark's point where we expect, on average, the market to be albeit reflecting a degree of uncertainty on both the upside and the downside. And then the third point to make would be irrespective of what the scenarios that transpire actually are, whether positive or negative, we have a track record of being able to adapt our business in a very agile way to reflect that economic scenario, from the upside and the ability to step up and build resource quickly to fulfill client expectations. And on the downside, if we need to an ability to take costs out. And to your point, that is about managing that sort of permanent prelaunch mix and the cost base in a relatively agile way.\nSo we feel that we're well prepared to base into both the positive and negative scenarios, but nonetheless, there's a very clear upgrade in the quarter, demonstrating the confidence and the positive track record we've seen come through Q1.\nMatthew Walker -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nBrilliant. That's very clear. Thanks very much indeed.\nMark Read\nThanks, everybody. Thanks for all your questions.

Now I will turn it over to Kevin. \nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. The third quarter was another great period of growth for DexCom. There are many things that we can highlight today, but let me give you three key statistics that point to the strength of our business. The third quarter represents our highest U.S.\ngrowth rate since the first quarter of 2016 when the business was much smaller. The third quarter included the highest absolute dollar growth in the history of our company, increasing nearly $130 million over the third quarter of 2018. We not only achieved profitability in the third quarter, but for the first time ever, through nine months, we are profitable on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The explanation for this performance remains relatively simple.\nMore and more people are becoming aware of the value of DexCom's real-time CGM. And with G6, we have the right product to meet their needs. We often highlight access and awareness as the primary answers for the growth that we are experiencing, but this is the result of years of work from the DexCom team. It is the result of many people embracing our core value to think big.\nWe think big in the way we design our products, the way we serve our patients, our approach to device integration and empowering user choice, and the way we structure our business to meet the expectations of our patients, our employees and our shareholders. Thinking big includes thinking about long-term profitability. As I stated earlier, through the first nine months of the year, we find ourselves profitable on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and on our way to our first GAAP profitable year. But even as we embrace this visionary mindset, it has not come without challenges.\nThis explosive growth continues to leave supply levels much tighter than we expected as we ramp capacity. And because of these supply constraints, our customer-facing infrastructure has been stretched to its limits. As Quentin will explain later, our guidance considers these challenges. I can assure you that as we think about DexCom's opportunities in diabetes and beyond, we are continuing to think big.\nIn addition, as many of you have recently seen, we've had some key developments over the past few months. In September, we began selling G6 in Canada and have seen a great response to this launch. In early October, we officially began shipping G6 to our Medicare patients. Toward this end, we are partnering with Walgreens to ensure that all Medicare patients can fill their prescriptions for DexCom CGM through any of Walgreens' nationwide retail locations.\nThis provides a wonderful opportunity to improve upon the DexCom experience for our Medicare patients and is an important step in our long-term move to the pharmacy as our primary distribution channel. As you can see, we are innovating beyond great product design and focusing on the customer experience that we create around the product. Whether this involves DexCom directly or work with our valued partners, we are thinking with the interest of our patients in mind. We continue to make excellent progress with our insulin delivery partners.\nAs Tandem Diabetes said on their call, they are on the verge of launching their advanced hybrid closed loop with Control-IQ system. On top of that, Insulet is making great progress with their Horizon closed-loop pump with DexCom G6 integration. The combination of Insulet and DexCom will provide a unique and compelling user experience and form factor. Our strategy for the intensive insulin delivery business is playing out according to our plan, and in fact, vastly exceeding our initial expectations.\nAs we look to the future, we continue to gather data on markets to pursue outside of our core intensive insulin business. We are investing in our new markets team to execute on this strategy and expect to increase investment there in the future. Time and time again, we are learning that our product has an incredible impact in these markets. Doctors all over the world are clamoring for real-time CGM use in the hospital to improve patient outcomes and streamline workflows for healthcare professionals in this environment.\nWe continue to believe that the opportunity for expanded use of DexCom in pregnancy is significant and are aware of several independent studies in progress around the world that will demonstrate the importance of CGM in this patient population. And finally, with respect to type two non-intensive diabetes and pre-diabetes, data from CGM usage continues to point to promising outcomes, including potential long-term cost reductions for this costly patient group. The experience here reminds us of where we were many years ago when we started our CGM First campaign for the intensive insulin market. While there may be many use cases for these patients, we believe that CGM will be the primary tool to drive improved outcomes in the type two non-intensive and pre-diabetes populations.\nAnd we all know the size of these markets. Overall, 2019 continues to exceed our expectations. Based on the strong third-quarter results, we are pleased again to be able to increase our revenue outlook, as well as our full-year operating margin and adjusted EBITDA targets. I will now turn the call over to Quentin, who will provide detail on this outlook, as well as a review of our financials.\nQuentin?\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nThank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. Today, we reported worldwide revenue of $396.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $266.7 million for the same quarter in 2018, representing growth of 49% on both a reported and constant-currency basis.\nOur momentum has continued, driven by strong new patient additions and customer satisfaction with G6. As Kevin mentioned, these factors drove absolute dollar growth of nearly $130 million versus the prior year, a new DexCom record and significantly above anything we've seen in the past. The U.S. business grew 53% in the third quarter, the fastest pace since early 2016, as the rapid adoption of CGM in the U.S.\nacross all of our major channels, continues to exceed our expectations and has been the primary driver of our outperformance this year. We continue to gain traction in our effort to prioritize customer access in our commercial business and believe that our efforts to remove upfront barriers across all channels, including the pharmacy, are contributing to new patient growth. Our OUS business continues to grow very well, ahead of our internal expectations. In the third quarter, we came up against our highest OUS growth comp in the past six years, with 93% year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2018.\nDespite that, we were still able to grow at 39% on a constant-currency basis or 36% on a reported basis, both of which represented a nice sequential uptick with solid increases across the board for both our direct and distributor markets. Our third-quarter gross profit was $246.9 million or 62.3% of sales, compared to 63.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2018. The Q3 sequential improvement of 90 basis points was in line with our expectations that we noted on the second-quarter call. While pricing remains consistent with our expectations and we are gaining the cost benefit of our new transmitter design, we did experience challenges with one of our automated G6 sensor production lines late in the third quarter which temporarily lowered production levels.\nThis lower production output, combined with the strong product demand, have left inventory levels tight as we head into the fourth quarter. As a result, the remaining transition from G5 to G6 for certain channels of our business will be slower than originally anticipated. We still expect a strong sequential improvement in gross margin in the fourth quarter, but the magnitude will be less than original expectations. We now expect full-year gross margin of approximately 63%, slightly lower than prior guidance.\nOperating expenses were $187.8 million for Q3 2019, compared to $153.9 million in Q3 2018. This reflects an increase of 22% year over year. The business continues to demonstrate excellent operating leverage, with third-quarter revenue growth once again exceeding the growth in operating expenses by more than two times. As a result of our continued focus on operational discipline and commitment to process improvement, robotics, automation in our Manila location, we are achieving leverage while maintaining investments into research and development of our core business while also increasing investments in new market opportunities.\nOperating income was $59.1 million or 14.9% of revenue in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $14.7 million or 5.5% of revenue in the same quarter of 2018. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 940 basis points in operating margins for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $92.5 million or 23.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $48 million or 18% of revenue for the third quarter of 2018. As our operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin indicate, we are making great progress toward our profitability targets, and we see these as strong indicators for the long-term cash flow potential of the business.\nNet income for the third quarter was $60.4 million or $0.65 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, we are now GAAP profitable for the first time in our company's history, and we are on track to deliver our first-ever full year of GAAP profitability. We remain in a strong cash position with greater than $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. Our immediate priority remains the expansion of our G6 production capacity, as well as capital investment in preparation for the eventual launch of G7.\nWe also continue to have flexibility as we invest to lengthen our growth runway, including our investments in support of our new markets team. Turning to guidance. Given the incredible growth that we have experienced through the first nine months of the year, we now anticipate 2019 total revenue of $1.425 billion to $1.450 billion, an increase of greater than $85 million at the midpoints of our prior incurring guidance, respectively. Importantly, and unlike prior guidance, this contemplates the production capability that we currently anticipate for the fourth quarter.\nThe revised revenue guidance implies an annual growth of 38% to 41%, which is an impressive organic growth number for a company of our size. As I mentioned previously, we now expect full-year gross margin of approximately 63%, improving sequentially in the fourth quarter as we start to realize the benefit of a full quarter of our new low-cost transmitter. In light of our better-than-expected revenue growth, we now expect operating margins of approximately 9% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 19.5%, reflecting increases of 200 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively, from our prior guidance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update.\nSteve Pacelli -- Executive Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development\nThanks, Quentin. Our great results in the third quarter are a validation of our strategic efforts, and we remain well-positioned to take advantage of our long-term growth opportunity. As some of you may have seen at September's EASD Conference in Barcelona, the full three-year results of our Comisair study showed that DexCom CGM, when paired with either insulin pumps or pens, drove an average increase of more than 20% to time and range. That is nearly five hours per day of improved glycemic control.\nAnother clear validation of DexCom CGM as the first-line defense for people with diabetes and that CGM connected devices are here to stay. Our insulin delivery partners continue to make progress on CGM-enabled integrated systems. As Kevin mentioned, with the pending approval and launch of Control-IQ, we are thrilled to be bringing our first advanced hybrid closed-loop technology to market and commend Tandem on their progress to date and their dedication to bring this best-in-class platform to reality. DexCom is proud to provide the enabling CGM and AP algorithm technology for this platform.\nTogether, these tools helped keep the system in a closed-loop mode 92% of the time during the pivotal study. Similarly, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Companion Medical are all making progress in their efforts to commercialize connected smartpens. We are seeing more and more interest from additional insulin delivery companies that recognize the value of connectivity to CGM, and we will continue to be the demonstrated leader in these efforts. As we expand the rollout of G6, we are simultaneously taking steps to prepare the way for G7 which we still plan to launch on a limited basis in late 2020 and more broadly in 2021.\nWe intend to be very thoughtful on the rollout of G7 as we scale the infrastructure necessary to support the anticipated demand for this exciting new platform. On our previous call, we announced the FDA submission of our G6 Pro product, and we were pleased to announce its approval in early October. This is another strong example of the streamlined review process enabled by our iCGM designation, giving us the opportunity to quickly iterate products to serve the needs of different customer segments. The G6 Pro represents the first disposable professional CGM product that is indicated for either blinded or unblinded real-time use.\nIn blinded mode, the product is available for all people, ages two and up. In unblinded mode, G6 Pro is indicated for all people with diabetes, ages two and up. Both options provide valuable insights into the impact of activity, food choices, medications and other factors on people's glucose levels. It also provides clinicians a wonderful tool to introduce their patients to real-time CGM and to adjust or optimize treatment based on observable patterns and time and range.\nWe've spoken at length this year about our efforts to improve access for our patients, whether advocating for coverage for type two intensive patients, pushing for ways to reduce the upfront cost to our patients or negotiating for the removal of administrative hurdles for patients to start on CGM. As you can see from various public and private data sources, we are making good progress with the long-term transition of the U.S. business to the pharmacy channel. As we've noted previously, this is a complex task.\nWe have long-standing relationships with our DME distributors and many of our patients have grown accustomed to their process through the DME channel. With these challenges noted, our field team is doing solid work, and we look forward to continued expansion through the pharmacy channel. Specific to formulary placement, we don't plan to comment on every contract win, as this is a normal part of our business operations. What we will say, as many of you have likely seen, is that we have good momentum here in our efforts.\nThe value of DexCom CGM speaks for itself, and payers and PBMs continue to demonstrate their understanding of what our product brings to the customer. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Steve. It is hard to continue to put words around the growth that we have seen since the launch of G6, and the third quarter is certainly no exception. At DexCom, we have the stated mission to empower people to take control of diabetes. As this quarter, and clinical studies like Comisair continues to demonstrate, we have a product that is enabling people to do just that.\nIt seems like every day we hear stories have people gaining confidence with their help. Children and patients living with less fear and overall quality of lives improving. These are the stories of people being empowered. To wrap up, 2019 has proven to be a wonderful year thus far, and we remain excited for the long road ahead.\nTo the DexCom team, let's finish the year strong. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen -- Senior Investor Relations Manager\nThank you, Kevin. [Operator instructions]\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] And your first question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nHey good afternoon guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. Congrats on what can only be described as a phenomenal quarter. I'll keep it to -- I'll follow instructions and keep it to one question. Kevin, you mentioned capacity -- some capacity challenges and the line that went down during the quarter.\nCan you give some additional color on how that factors into your guidance for the remainder of the year? And why you weren't concerned about meeting increasing demand going forward? Thanks so much.\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks for the question, Danielle. Give a little history here. We launched G6 a year ago, and we launched it earlier than we planned. And we've been chasing this ever since we started.\nAs you look at 2019, we've grown over $300 million in the first three quarters and $130 million in the last quarter. And while we've experienced large growth percentages in the past, we've never experienced anything like this. We committed to doubling our capacity this year. And by the time we exit the year, in all fairness, we will have double the capacity to build G6 product that we had before.\nWe're doing everything we can to put additional capacity in place to meet the demand for the fourth quarter. As we talked about, our manufacturing line went down in September, late in the third quarter and for some time early in the fourth quarter. That's production we can't make up today. We do have some levers to pull and some things that might come on board in December.\nWe can see some upside to making that up. And in our worst case, we assume in our guidance this year that we're not going to make that up. We're not going to plan on that. And if we do, there's some upside there.\nSo by the time we exit the year, we will have doubled our G6 capacity. And I can tell you we have more automated lines coming on, some in the first quarter, more in the second quarter to the point by the time you get to the middle of 2020, we will have doubled our capacity again and be able to serve everybody. We're confident we have enough capacity to meet the numbers that we've given you. We believe we have an opportunity to do more if certain things go well, and then we'll go from there.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open.\nMargaret Kaczor -- William Blair & Company -- Analyst\nHey, guys, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. First one for me. It's a little bit tagging answer, and from Danielle, in terms of the marketplace demand that you're seeing. Given the capacity constraints you have, I assume a lot of the growth that you're seeing is actually push-driven, meaning that patients are educated and they're reaching out to you versus you trying to convince them.\nSo is that true? And then should we assume that patient add growth is still growing at the same pace or better than U.S. revenue growth and why or why that shouldn't change going forward? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYou know what, let me start with that. And if Quentin, Steve want to jump in, they can. With respect to new patients, Q3 was very comparable to Q2. We had a very good new patient, third quarter.\nAnd so that has not been an issue with respect to patients reordering. We have not seen a change in reordering patterns from our patients. They're ordering what and when they can and when their insurance will reimburse for them. So there's no real difference here as to what we've experienced in the past.\nIn reality, what we're experiencing, what we're working through is getting product out to them as quickly as we can. Sometimes they wait just an extra day for the product, sometimes it's as long as a week. But we are getting product to everybody. We'd like to get it to them sooner, and we'd like to have more at our discretion here.\nBut we're keeping up with everything. And we're doing well.\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nI think Margaret, the only thing I would add is it's a combination of both, right? I mean patients continue to become more and more aware of the technology and find their way to the device. And clearly, our commercial team continues to do just an outstanding job of creating opportunities as well. So it's a bit of both. And the new patient additions continue to outpace overall revenue growth.\nSo it's a strong indicator of where the business is heading.\nMargaret Kaczor -- William Blair & Company -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\nThank you. Good afternoon, guys. I was -- I wanted to ask -- I know, Steve, you said you're not going to say a lot on formulary status, but we've seen a few positive moves with the sizable payers for 2020 with regards to DexCom's placement. So I'm wondering, what's driving that favorable treatment into next year? Maybe how does some of your tiering placements for next year compared to your lower price competitor? And Quentin, are you still comfortable with the $100 million to $125 million pricing headwind next year as you give up some price to move into pharmacy? Or are these big wins, maybe push that expectation a little bit higher in trade-off or volume? Thank you.\nSteve Pacelli -- Executive Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development\nSo I'll start off, and then I'll turn it over to Quentin on the numbers. Yes. Look, I mean, this is what we told you guys. We're executing on exactly what we told you we would do, which is why it was somewhat tongue in cheek, the prepared remarks, that we're not going to put a press release out every time we get a new pharmacy win.\nBut this is what we told you we would do. We've been telling you we would do this, and we're executing on our plans. And with respect to pricing, Quentin you can comment?\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nYes. No. It's right in line with what we have always anticipated, Jeff. I don't, at this point, see any need to kind of revise the expectation we've put out there.\nI think that $100 million to $125 million of headwinds is something that we'll continue to see throughout the course of next year. But we aren't changing our strategy here. I think what's being demonstrated is that our plan is being effective. It's working, and the payers are seeing the value of our products.\nAnd they understand it for the premium product that it is, and we're opening doors. So no change there.\nOperator\nAnd your next question is from Ryan Blicker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nRyan Blicker -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nHi, thanks for taking my questions. For G7, how much progress have you made working on automating your manufacturing processes over the past few months? And is there still a significant amount of work to be done, nailing down your exact manufacturing process? And then for G7 overall, what are the biggest steps in the development process you hope to accomplish over the next few months? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nHi, this is Kevin. I'll take that. G7 is on schedule as we sit right now with the schedule that we put together on all fronts. We are now in the process of evaluating the final tweaks to the configuration to lock down the entire design.\nThe majority of the design is locked down, but we've got a -- as always, when we get to this point in the sensor, what's that exact sensor configuration going to be, and then we've got some algorithm and some effort to do, but none of that will slow down the clinical study. With respect to the total automation of the G7 plant, Steve, very, very truthfully said we're going to do a limited launch in 2020 and be careful how we launch in 2021. We don't want to put ourselves in a position we're talking about today, because we see that as a product that we can market to the world at great, great -- with great, great success. So our automated lines are in design.\nThey're being built. The equipment's not all in yet because the process isn't completely done. But things like ordering molds which have a long lead time and things of that nature are happening. And you will see significant capital expenditures by us over the next several months as we get these lines up and running.\nWe have a great automation team. We have good processes that we're counting on. They'll certainly be adjusted as the product becomes more mature. The product was designed to be more manufacturable than G6.\nSo we think these processes could be simpler over time. And I'll just add one other thing. We're not just asking the guys to automate G7, at the same time, they're automating the G6 factory, as well as we have automated lines for the assembly of our G6 product going up both in San Diego and in our Mesa facility. So we've got a lot on our plate manufacturing-wise.\nWe're confident with the progress we're making, what the guys are doing, and expect a very successful launch in product.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDavid Lewis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGood afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter. Yes, Quentin, just in terms of just the fourth-quarter guidance, you typically guide a fair amount of sequential deceleration, kind of in line with historical precedent. And in the fourth quarter, it's a little heavier than normal coming off a very, very strong third quarter. Is there anything from a timing perspective or pull-forward perspective for the fourth quarter that's worth calling out?\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me just talk through the fourth quarter for a second and give you a little bit of color on it. There's nothing significant in terms of timing that, I think, changes the impact of either Q3 or Q4. But one thing to keep in mind is the OUS business is a bit more choppy than the rest of our business. The sequential trends there can move around a little bit.\nIf you look historically, international has typically been flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect that's how it will play out this year. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that as we continue to move more and more of the business toward a subscription-based model, the historic seasonality is going to play a little bit differently in the current year than what we've seen throughout history. So we're trying to model that as well. I think the other thing just to keep in mind is, Q3 was truly a remarkable quarter for us.\nWe were up 18% sequentially from Q2, whereas, historically, we've been up 8% to 10%. So for us to look at that and call it a trend and anticipate that we're going to see the same sequential increase into the fourth quarter, that's a bit premature. We want to see this play out a little bit longer than just 90 days worth of experience in the third quarter. So we're trying to be mindful of that.\nAnd I think the other thing just that is worth noting, and Kevin has hit on it, we are capacity -- we're at the top end of the capacity in our guidance range. And if we can pull some of these incremental opportunities forward in terms of production lines, then terrific. There's going to be opportunity to exceed what we set the expectation for. Worst-case scenario, as those lines come up in the very early part of January, and we're off and running at that point.\nBut if we can get those brought forward, then there's potential upside.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThanks, and congrats on a great quarter. I was wondering if you could just help parse out what the drivers of growth were, clearly breaking down the barriers of costs that the pharmacy is having a big impact. But anything you could add on Medicare versus pharmacy versus DME would be really helpful. Thank you.\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nOur big driver this quarter was the U.S. commercial business. Our U.S. commercial business, not Medicare, but our U.S.\ncommercial patients and our U.S. commercial revenues grew at a rate faster than any quarter we've ever seen. And that was the primary driver. Medicare growth continues to be good.\nBut in all fairness, in the third quarter, we know there's some pent-up demand for patients to shift over to G6. We expect Medicare to really take off next year as we roll out our Walgreens and pharmacy delivery mechanism for the Medicare patients and make it much easier for them and get them all over to G6. International was also a great quarter. The growth sequentially there was very strong.\nQuentin talked about the fact that we're comparing to a 93% growth quarter internationally last year, and we still grew 39% over that number. So the international markets were good as well. I really can't tell you whether it's DME or pharmacy that's driving it. I think just the drive is awareness.\nAnd people are becoming much more aware of CGM, and what it can do for them and having great experiences with the product that we have.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Your line is open.\nKyle Rose -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congrats on a terrific quarter. You talked a little bit -- or talked at length about some of the capacity from a manufacturing perspective. But if we look back at some of the last two years, when you think about some of the growth you've had, you've also been somewhat constrained just from a customer support perspective.\nGiven the surge in growth from a new patient perspective, maybe help us understand just what other investments and infrastructure changes you're making from a customer support perspective, both currently now with the G6. I know you went to OUS or offshore in some of that support earlier this year, but also in prep for G7 in 2020 and then 2020 and beyond. And then I'll hop back in queue. Thank you.\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nYes. Well, certainly, the operation that we've set up in Manila has turned into a real corporate asset of ours. I think you look at the performance that we're seeing there, both from a quantitative, qualitative perspective, quite honestly, we're operating at some of the highest levels that we've ever seen in the company's history. And that's allowing us to scale more aggressively than what we have historically and address some of the increasing demand that we see.\nI think another thing that we spend a tremendous amount of time looking for opportunities in the organization is just around what we call RPA or robotic automation and taking processes that are incredibly labor-intensive and finding those aspects of those processes and automating those, so that the folks who are doing those things can focus really more on value-added capabilities to the organization and serving the patients or even our commercial team in a much better way. And I think, encouragingly, we're seeing NPS scores start to reach some of their highest levels here in recent weeks than what we've seen over the last 18 to 24 months, even before we started down the path of taking some of the things outside the States and into the Philippines. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing. We continue to make investments in those ways.\nI think as we continue to head into the future, the more we can automate the patient experience with us and eliminate the need for a live person to be on the other end of every phone call, the greater we're going to have an ability to scale and improve the patient experience along the way. So those are the things we're focused on. We're encouraged by what we're seeing. But to be fair and truthful, it has been a challenge over the time that the growth has really put pressure on it.\nAnd we're doing everything we can to stay out ahead of it.\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nI'd just add one other thing. We have an opportunity with G7 to reset the bar as to how we're going to act with patients and what distribution and reimbursement channels we'll pursue. Everything we're doing with G6 is positioning us to put G7 in its most accessible light to make sure patients can get right to it. Again, our Walgreens announcement with the Medicare patients to whereby Medicare patients will be able to go to Walgreens and get their monthly supplies, rather than calling us and being on the phone with us or our distributors, is a major win.\nI was on the phone with a physician just a couple of weeks ago, and he explained to me his frustration with -- we have three or four Medicare distributors on ourselves, and all three of those ask -- all of those ask for different paperwork. We think we can make this much more efficient for our patients with that move. And that's part of the innovation and thinking big I was referring to. We're going to make this easier.\nAnd so everything we're doing with G6 is going to fly right into G7, and we are preparing to become a company that serves several million patients, not just several hundred thousand.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJayson Bedford -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nThanks, and good afternoon. So I guess, just given the U.S. growth, I think it begs the question around traction in people with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. So can you just comment on what you're seeing in this patient population and the impact the pharmacy has had on penetrating this opportunity?\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nI'll take that, Jason. We are growing in that space, but in all fairness, we do not have the broad reimbursement for insulin-using type 2 patients that we so desire. Medicare covers those patients. And some of the payers have come along, and some of them have not.\nWe think it will continue to grow over time. But even with our pharmacy contracts, there are sometimes limitations as to what insulin-using patients can have access to our technology. We are negotiating through that. We are willing to give, for example, willing to give price to have those patients covered if they will cover them.\nThe Medicare patients do have coverage. And that's where a large portion of this population exists. And we will be able to get those and go after them. But it's still a chore and it's still not -- certainly not the majority of our business, even the majority of our Medicare patients at this point in time.\nIt's a great growth opportunity for us.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi. Congratulations on an outstanding quarter. So it's been almost a year since you laid out the various non-core market opportunities at your Analyst Day. You've got a dedicated team looking at that and doing research there.\nJust love to hear kind of what you've learned over the last year if there's anything you can elaborate on in terms of different business models or any different views on the market sizes there?\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. This is Kevin. I'll let Steve and Quentin take a little more of that, too, because we've all had interesting experiences. As this has evolved, we've gone from -- we're going to have a complicated type two program to using other programs, to having payers run the thing, to how is this model going to go.\nAnd the one learning that I've seen that I'll share with you is, it doesn't matter what the model is. CGM is what drives it. And I think there's going to be opportunities across the board, directly with payers, directly with the programmatic entities, directly with employers, directly with clinics to better manage these patients. And you'll see CGM usage vary from model to model.\nThere are some who think you need a specific number per year, but the most recent group I talked to said, \"I just put them on them on it all the time because we get such good results.\" We don't know how it's going to play out. But again, look at the size of that market and look at the amount of dollars spent taking care of those patients. Look at the cost of drugs for those patients and their effectiveness. We think there's a cost savings play here that might be even greater than what we're saving in the type 1 space and intensive insulin using space, when all is said and done, if we can develop the right algorithms to get into the right groups.\nI don't know, Steve, Quentin, you got to anything?\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nNo. I think you hit it just right.\nSteve Pacelli -- Executive Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development\nYes. I don't have anything to add to that.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from JP McKim from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\nUnknown speaker\nGood afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. It's actually Matt on for JP. So as I look back at the business on the top line over the last five years, you guys haven't grown less than 25% per year in any of those last five. In the last two, it's been much, much faster than that.\nSo as we think forward a little bit, I know you've got a little bit of capacity constraint at the moment, but it seems like you've got a lot of tailwinds here on the Medicare side and the pharmacy side. So is there anything specifically that could keep you from that level of growth as we look forward?\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nYes. I think, Matt, more than anything else, as that business gets larger and you get into kind of the law of large numbers, the growth rate continues to come under pressure. I think that you look at -- last year, we grew $300 million year-over-year in terms of absolute dollar growth this year. At the midpoint, we're talking about $400 million of absolute dollar growth, yet the growth rate is arguably a little bit slower, still at elevated levels, but arguably slower.\nSo I think that as we continue to move into the future, the rates' going to just be pressured from the tougher and tougher comps that we have and a larger base of business. But you hit the nail on the head. There's a lot to be bullish about. And we couldn't be more bullish around the opportunities that sit in front of us within the core business itself, the alternative market opportunities.\nI mean these markets are enormous. And I think what we learn more and more every day is that at the end of the day, it's CGM device that really opens up the opportunity to either impact cost, improve a patient's life, whatever it might be. It comes right back to our device. So we couldn't be more bullish about the future.\nBut at the same time, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves. We're going to be thoughtful, but we're going to pursue every one of those growth opportunities as far as we can.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMathew Blackman -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\nGood afternoon, everyone. You guys spent a lot of time answering questions about the pricing implications of pharmacy access. I was hoping you could talk a bit about the potential profitability implications of increasing mix running through the pharmacy.\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nYes. I think the pharmacy is a very, very attractive business model for us. Obviously, it reduces the burden that a patient and a physician and even our back-office staff here has to work through to get a patient onto the technology. So it's attractive from that perspective.\nBut it's also very attractive from a profitability perspective. We firmly believe that we can make more profit dollars per patient through the pharmacy channel than we can to the DME channel. So -- and much of that comes by way of reducing the back office effort and just reducing the amount of time that it takes to get that patient on to the product. And then it clearly opens up by having easier access, the opportunity to address more of the market.\nSo for all those reasons, pharmacy is very attractive to us, but from a profitability perspective, it's going to deliver profit dollars on a per-patient basis that are higher than the DME channel.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Steven, your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nThank you. Hi, guys. Yes. Just following up on the very strong international performance.\nWere there any standouts in particular that stood out? Or was it across the board? And what was the -- what are some of the big new opportunities you're focused on ahead outside of the U.S.? Thanks.\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nI'll speak to the quarter itself. I mean it's pretty simple, and maybe Steve or Kevin can speak to the opportunities. But within the quarter, it was very widespread. It was across our direct markets, it was across our distributor markets and it was across all of the regions.\nThere wasn't anyone country, in particular, that far and away led the pack. There wasn't anyone country that was far and away behind the pack either. So it continues to be very broad-based strength across each and every one of our markets and the teams' are doing a remarkable job with it.\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nI'd just add, I spoke a bit about the Canadian launch in September. And that launch was a great success and win for our Canadian team. If I depict one other geography, the one I'll call out is the U.K. They had a month in December that far exceed -- I mean, September, that far exceeded anything that had ever done.\nAnd we're pretty proud of the results. And we got an email, \"Hey, we just hit this mark.\" And it's pretty exciting because we don't have widespread reimbursement in the U.K., it's regional, and there's a lot of cash pay. We think as we grow in the U.K., we can get widespread reimbursement, and then this becomes a much greater market for us. So kudos to the U.K.\nteam as well.\nSteve Pacelli -- Executive Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development\nYes. I think the only final add for me would be, as you guys are building models, don't build anything significant this year from Japan. But Kevin and I just spent some time over in Japan. And kind of detailed G6 for the first time, G6 is filed in Japan.\nAnd we expect to launch it there, probably the first half of next year. And there's some real excitement around that product. So we'll get you guys updated when the time comes. But that's still really a nonexistent market for us at this point.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale -- Guggenheim Partners LLC -- Analyst\nThanks, and congrats on the quarter, guys. Quentin, the SG&A leverage this quarter was very impressive. Can you talk about the sustainability of that? You didn't raise EBITDA guidance by quite as much as I thought you may have given the progress this quarter. So I'm just wondering if there was anything in terms of timing of spend that may have shifted some dollars from Q3 into Q4.\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nNo. Nothing specific around the timing of spend, although I will tell you, in the fourth quarter, we're going to start to see some incremental spend, particularly around the development efforts of automating these G7 lines. We have the product pretty well dialed in, in terms of its design. Now it's all about designing these lines.\nAnd conceptually, we know what the lines need to look like, what they need to produce. Now it's fine-tuning that work and making sure that we have them up ready to start to roll. So you've got that cost coming through in the fourth quarter that you didn't necessarily have in the third quarter. To your point, on a year-to-date basis, we made incredible traction from a profitability perspective.\nOPEX has levered over 1,000 basis points. And on a full-year basis, we're going to see tremendous leverage from both an operating margin and EBITDA margin, even though it might not have been raised in line with what you were expecting. It's still tremendous improvements. I think what it tells you is that this business has the capability to perform very appealing profitability measures if you will.\nThere's nothing structurally in the business model that keeps us from being able to do that. I think what we want to be able to do is balance the investments that are going to open up all these new growth opportunities, that we continue to become more convicted are real. And so we're going to balance that over time. But we remain committed to those long-term profitability goals we've laid out.\nWe're making tremendous progress toward them and feel good about where we're at today. So we're pleased with the progress that's being made.\nOperator\nAnd there are no questions at this time.\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nAll right. This is Kevin. I'm going to close up as I usually do. We want to thank everybody for participating on the call this quarter.\nIn closing, I want to acknowledge the contribution of all of our team members to get to this point. $130 million in growth in this quarter combined with our best financial results ever. We've never delivered a quarter like this. And we've asked our people to go above and beyond in 2019 to achieve these things.\nWhile our year-to-date revenue growth is near 50%, I can assure you all that our volume growth, of all product components, far exceeds that number. And we've been running all year to keep up. And while we see a light at the end of the tunnel, it's just not as quickly as we'd hoped for. Our commercial teams have hit on all cylinders this year.\nInternational growth remains strong and a great opportunity going forward for us is global access and awareness continues to improve. We also talked about the effectiveness of our U.S. reimbursement team and positioning us for the future, enabling our shift to more efficient distribution channels with numerous contract wins and our relationships throughout our distribution channels have been nothing but strengthen over the course of the year. And finally, our U.S.\nsales team, both internal and external. They've navigated through some very difficult situations with respect to our supply constraints, yet remain engaged and effective. There isn't a better group anywhere. Many of our accomplishments this year can be measured by numbers, all of the letters and emails of lives that we've changed.\nStanding up a facility and a business in the Philippines over the past 9 months that's grown to a nearly 700-person workforce of people who have committed to this company, as everybody here in the States, and who demonstrate the commitment to patients that we've always had that have made DexCom the company than it is today. We look forward to continuing this success in the future. Thank you.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 50 minutes\nCall participants:\nSean Christensen -- Senior Investor Relations Manager\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nQuentin Blackford -- Chief Operating Officer\nSteve Pacelli -- Executive Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Leerink -- Analyst\nMargaret Kaczor -- William Blair & Company -- Analyst\nJeff Johnson -- Robert W.
